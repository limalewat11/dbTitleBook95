How has the fall affected this image? Who <em>are</em> the people of God?</strong> Addressing these core questions about spiritual identity, <em>From Adam and Israel to the Church</em> examines the nature of the people of God from Genesis to Revelation through the lens of being created and formed in God's image. Benjamin Gladd argues that living out God's image means serving as prophets, priests, and kings, and he explains how God's people function in these roles throughout Scripture&#x2015;from Adam and Eve to the nation of Israel, from Jesus to the church. The consistent call of the people of God is to serve as God's image-bearers in the world. This first volume in Essential Studies in Biblical Theology lays a foundation for subsequent volumes, introducing key biblical-theological themes such as temple, king, priest, prophet, creation, and redemption. Essential Studies in Biblical Theology (ESBT), edited by Benjamin L. Gladd, explore the central or "essential" themes of the Bible's grand storyline. Taking cues from Genesis 1-3, authors explore the presence of these themes throughout the entire sweep of redemption history. Written for students, church leaders, and laypeople, the ESBT offers an introduction to biblical theology.</p><p>Benjamin L. Gladd (PhD, Wheaton) is associate professor of New Testament at Reformed Theological Seminary and series editor for <em>Essential Studies in Biblical Theology</em>. His publications include <em>Hidden But Now Revealed</em>, <em>Making All Things New</em>, and <em>The Story Retold</em>."The main storyline and big message of the Bible can be told from many different angles. Benjamin Gladd's book takes a surprising approach, insisting that not only is Jesus God's prophet, priest, and king&#x2015;we too, as those created in God's image and being conformed to the image of Christ, are to live as prophets, priests, and kings. The book is a remarkably comprehensive and compelling description of God's work in the world." (Brian S. Rosner, principal, Ridley College, Australia)<br><br>"Rare is the resource that brings together substantive biblical reflection with ecclesial sensitivity and relevance. That's why I'm delighted to see the launch of the Essential Studies in Biblical Theology series. Each volume expounds a central biblical-theological theme in a way that helps pastors, students, and laypeople alike not lose the forest of Scripture's overarching storyline from the trees of its myriad of motifs and subplots. And what better way to kick off such a promising series than with Benjamin Gladd's fine study of the nature of the people of God from Genesis to Revelation through the lens of being in God's image. Highly recommend!" (Todd Wilson, president of the Center for Pastor Theologians)<br><br>"An ambitious undertaking that makes an immense amount of biblical theology accessible to readers at any level. Gladd's study of the people of God is clearly grounded in the biblical text, uses covenant theology with a light but precise touch, and seamlessly integrates practical application. Despite its focus on a single theme, it integrates numerous other themes along the way, and so is almost a whole-Bible theology in miniature." (Daniel Timmer, professor of biblical studies in the doctoral program, Puritan Reformed Theological Seminary, professeur d'Ancien Testament � la Facult� de Th�ologie �vang�lique, Montr�al)<br><br>"In this concise, clear book Ben Gladd helps us understand the crucial connections between image of God and the roles of prophet, priest, and king. Gladd masterfully guides us through the Bible to see how Jesus, the true Israel, embodies and models these roles, which are now the calling of his church. I highly recommend this book as a guide for putting the whole Bible together with Jesus at the center." (Chris Bruno, associate dean and assistant professor of New Testament and biblical theology at Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary)<br><br>"From Genesis to Revelation, Benjamin Gladd deftly guides the reader through Scripture and unpacks the rich mosaic of the people of God. Giving attention to various canonical themes such as temple, image, Israel, king, priest, and prophet, Gladd not only shows how Christ fulfills them but also how the church&#x2015;as the people of God in Christ&#x2015;lives before him. Even those who disagree with some aspects of Gladd's approach will be encouraged and challenged to 'develop new creational patterns' of living now while waiting for the not yet, when Christ comes again to make all things new." (Oren R. Martin, assistant professor of Christian theology at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Boyce College)</p><h2>Belisarius Cawl: The Great Work (Warhammer 40,000)</h2><p><b><b>Warhammer 40,000 fans rejoice - Belisarius Cawl has his own novel! Join him on his journey to the abandoned world of Sotha which hides a long-buried secret... and an ancient evil.</b></b><br><br>Belisarius Cawl, Archmagos Dominus of the Adeptus Mechanicus is the most brilliant mind alive. For 10,000 years he has furthered the cause of mankind, working under the aegis of the Emperor and Lord Commander Roboute Guilliman to prevent the inexorable march of the alien and the traitor. Many call him heretic, but all must recognise the magnitude of his achievements, for who else but he was entrusted to create a new generation of Space Marines? Who else but the great Belisarius Cawl could even accomplish such a task?<br> Now, in the wake of the Great Rift and the Indomitus Crusade, his ambitions bring him to the long-dead world of Sotha, once home to the Scythes of the Emperor, now a barren wasteland devoured by the vile Tyranids. Accompanied by Tetrarch Felix and his elite warriors, it is here that Cawl believes the lynchpin of his mysterious Great Work lies. But uncovering it is a near impossible task, one in which the Archmagos must overcome an ancient evil that threatens to extinguish the last hope of humanity.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Guy Haley is the author of the Siege of Terra novel The Lost and the Damned, as well as the Horus Heresy novels Titandeath, Wolfsbane and Pharos, and the Primarchs novels Konrad Curze: The Night Haunter, Corax: Lord of Shadows and Perturabo: The Hammer of Olympia.

He lives in Yorkshire with his wife and son.</p><h2>The Apostles&#39; Creed for Today</h2><p><p>This volume in the popular For Today series, written by the highly respected theologian and author Justo Gonz�lez, explains the familiar Apostles' Creed in easy, accessible language. Gonz�lez explores not only what the Creed meant in the early centuries but also its ongoing importance and relevance for Christian faith and practice today.</p><p>The For Today series was designed to provide reliable and accessible resources for the study and real life application of important biblical texts, theological documents, and Christian practices. The emphasis of the series is not only on the realization and appreciation of what these subjects have meant in the past, but also on their value in the present--"for today." Thought-provoking questions are included at the end of each chapter, making the books ideal for personal study and group use.</p></p><p><b>Justo L.

She learned from an early age what made her miserable, and for Scaachi anything can be cause for despair. Whether it&#x2019;s a shopping trip gone awry; enduring awkward conversations with her bikini waxer; overcoming her fear of flying while vacationing halfway around the world; dealing with Internet trolls, or navigating the fears and anxieties of her parents. Alongside these personal stories are pointed observations about life as a woman of color: where every aspect of her appearance is open for critique, derision, or outright scorn; where strict gender rules bind in both Western and Indian cultures, leaving little room for a woman not solely focused on marriage and children to have a career (and a life) for herself.</p><p>With a sharp eye and biting wit, incomparable rising star and cultural observer Scaachi Koul offers a hilarious, scathing, and honest look at modern life.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2017:</strong> Some of the best books, in my opinion, don't really end when you turn the final page. Instead, something about them sticks with you, causes you to look back, challenges you, or maybe just revisits you from time to time. <em>One Day We'll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter</em> qualifies. In this case, not only do many of Scaachi Koul's laugh-out-loud accounts of her experiences in her everyday life bring smiles time and time again, they also strike with a surprising poignancy that both speaks to your core and challenges you moving forward. It's great for bite-sized reads in its structure, but good luck not devouring it in one sitting. Either way, the end seems to come much too soon. I&#x2019;m expecting more great things from this author! <em>--Penny Mann, The Amazon Book Review</em><b>Scaachi Koul </b>was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta, and is a culture writer for <i>BuzzFeed.</i> Her writing has also appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Hairpin</i>, <i>The Globe and Mail</i>, and <i>Jezebel</i>. <i>One Day We&#x2019;ll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter</i> is her first book. She lives in Toronto.</p><h2>Reformation Women: Sixteenth-Century Figures Who Shaped Christianity&#39;s Rebirth</h2><p>Women are an essential element in church history. Just as Deborah, Esther, and the New Testament Marys helped shape Bible history, so the women of the Reformed church have helped to make its history great.<p> In Reformation Women, Rebecca Vandoodewaard introduces readers to twelve sixteenth-century women who are not as well known today as contemporaries like Katie Luther and Lady Jane Grey. Providing an example to Christians today of strong service to Christ and His church, these influential, godly women were devoted to Reformation truth, in many cases provided support for their husbands, practiced hospitality, and stewarded their intellectual abilities. Their strength and bravery will inspire you, and your understanding of church history will become richer as you learn how God used them to further the Reformation through their work and influence.</p><p> <b>Table of Contents: </b><br> Anna Reinhard<br> Anna Adlischweiler<br> Katharina Schutz<br> Margarethe Blaurer<br> Marguerite de Navarre<br> Jeanne'd Albret<br> Charlotte Arbaleste<br> Charlotte de Bourbon<br> Louise de Coligny<br> Catherine Willoughby<br> Renee of Ferrara<br> Olympia Morata<br> Conclusion<br> <b>Appendices</b><br> Timeline<br> French family tree<br> Dutch family tree<br> British family tree<br> Bucer's letters to Margarethe Blaurer</p></p><p>Table of Contents: <p> 1.

There are women-prophets in the communities around biblical Israel, existing for hundreds of years and even a thousand years before the Israelite and Judean prophets recorded their messages. The rabbinic and Christian fathers analyzed and found more women in the scriptures who function as prophets than the biblical authors identify. All of these female prophets have an intimate connection with the God of Israel; they express that connection by singing, dancing, drumming, speaking with and for God, waging war, performing miracles, exercising statecraft, and giving birth. Each of them is a daughter of Miriam, the mother of all women-prophets.<br><br>Women prophets gave powerful voice to Yahwist faith at the formative moments in ancient Israel s development, and were expected in biblical visions of the future. Now they come to the foreground as Wilda Gafney explores prophetic practices in ancient Israel, its near eastern environment, and early and rabbinic Judaism as well.</p><p>Wilda C.

In his latest book, the #1<i> New York Times </i>bestselling author &#x201c;writes reflectively and poetically about the lifelong spiritual journey&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).<br><br>Called one of the finest spiritual guides of our time, Nepo explores what it means to become our truest self as we face life&#x2019;s challenges&#x2014;as well as its joys. Navigating some of the soul&#x2019;s deepest, most ancient questions, he asks: How do we stay vital and buoyant amid the storms of life? What is the secret to coming alive? The soul&#x2019;s journey is inevitable, and no matter where we go we can&#x2019;t escape this foundational truth: <i>What&#x2019;s in the way is the way</i>. As Nepo writes, &#x201c;The point of experience is not to escape life but to live it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Featured on Oprah&#x2019;s <i>Super Soul Sunday</i> program, and a key presenter in Oprah&#x2019;s nationwide The Life You Want Weekend Tour, Nepo inspires each of us to discover who we were born to be.

Plankton are organisms&#x2014;comparable to sea larvae and tiny jellyfish&#x2014;that drift in oceans, seas, and bodies of fresh water. The word <i>zooplankton </i>comes from the Greek <i>zoion</i>, meaning animal, and <i>planktos</i>, meaning wanderer or drifter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their migration isn&#x2019;t like the journey of whales or butterflies or flamingoes over thousands of miles or like caribou who circle the same arctic edge every year. The daily migration of these unseeable creatures is a persistent drift from depth to surface and back to depth. Along the way, they eat and process phytoplankton and, through their daily rite of survival, they serve as a filtering agent and so play their role in the aquatic food web. Innately, they both survive and contribute to the survival of the waters they live in.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This daily odyssey can span a few feet in small ponds or as far as five hundred yards in the open sea. Environmentalist Alan Burdick tells us that this is equivalent to a human being rowing a small boat five hundred miles every day to breakfast and back!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is microscopic evidence that we need to work very hard to arrive where we are. The journey is inevitable&#x2014;essential to our own survival and the health of the Universe we are a small part of. In fact, it&#x2019;s fair to assume that every part of life has its own version of this daily migration by which it exercises its being into place.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This persistent drifting from depth to surface and back is particularly instructive for the life of the soul, and how we need to stay in the world and process our experience in order to feed and cleanse both our working spirit and the small part of the Universe we inhabit. For years, I thought I was inwardly fickle, struggling to surface when drowning in the deep, only to be battered at the surface and long for the stillness of the depth. And now these microscopic creatures present a fractal of the larger physics at work. Now I wonder about <i>the practice of persistent drift</i>&#x2014;from depth to surface and back&#x2014;and how the many aspects of being and becoming are all part of the constant cleansing action that keeps us and life healthy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spiritually practical ways, this book is an inquiry into the practice of persistent drift: into the cleansing action of introspection, creativity, love, friendship, and how we deal with pain; into our need to stay in the world and process our experience; into the very hard and inevitable work to arrive where we are; and into the soul&#x2019;s daily migration from depth to surface and back. Relentlessly, the sea of life keeps us vital and buoyant while we in our small way serve as tiny cleansing agents of the sea of life. Mysteriously, spirit is known by its movement through the depth of the world, the way wind is known by its movement through waves and trees and prayer flags strung along the mountain&#x2019;s ridge.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So still yourself briefly and picture an infinite wave of zooplankton pulsing their way up through the planet&#x2019;s water and down again, cleansing it as they go. Imagine the tiniest cells of being rising within you this very moment, cleansing your thoughts and feelings. Imagine how you and I pulse our way through the days eating and processing the food of relationship, meaning, and care. All of us processing each other, drifting toward the healthiest exchange, the way plants and humans exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite our endless plans, we are animals of being drifting with an instinct to survive and process. Despite our endless struggles, our need to survive and process is cleansing. It&#x2019;s beautiful and humbling to realize that the spirit inherent in each thing on Earth, including worms and flowers, is migrating to where it is and that this pulsation of being is the self-cleansing agent of all life-force. After all this way, it&#x2019;s never been about getting to the surface or getting to the bottom, but the inborn call to inhabit the journey in between.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The daily migration is a persistent drift from depth to surface and back to depth. This is how we deal with pain and stay in the world while cleansing life itself&#x2014;through introspection, creativity, love, and friendship.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><i>A Reflective Pause</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i>In your journal, describe one way that you move between depth and surface during your day. Where are you more comfortable, in the world or the interior? One is a native strength, the other, an aspect of your self you need to know better. Name one way you might explore whichever you are uncomfortable with, the world or the interior.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i>In conversation with a friend or loved one, describe your own practice of persistent drift. Choose one of the following&#x2014;introspection, creativity, love, or friendship&#x2014;and explore how this inner way of being helps you deal with pain and stay in the world.</i></p><h2>NEKOMONOGATARI (BLACK): Cat Tale</h2><p>Following up on the high note&nbsp;of family ties on which the previous installment concluded, but preceding it chronologically, we find Araragi and his little&nbsp;sister Tsukihi, the heroine of&nbsp;the last volume, in full sibling&nbsp;rivalry mode as they bicker about love. The conversation that&nbsp;cannot end unfolds in its unabashed original glory herein.<br><br> Like KIZUMONOGATARI, which delved into our narrator&#x2019;s&nbsp;disastrous spring break, Cat Tale (Black) is a prequel about another catastrophe, mentioned often yet never recounted even in a foregoing chapter dedicated&nbsp;to Miss H.: namely, the model student&#x2019;s rampage over Golden&nbsp;Week, a string of holidays starting at the end of April.<br><br> Closing out what has come to be known as the &#x201c;First Season&#x201d;&nbsp;of the series, this episode of &#x2019;GATARI, as rich as ever in silly banter and poignant profundities, richer than usual in snide meta comments about the anime, will make you laugh and cry, or just put a grownup smile on your face, maybe, but is guaranteed to stay with you forever.</p><p>Palindromic NISIOISIN made his debut as a novelist when he was twenty.

Rather than providing exuberant accounts or cautionary tales, it offers a data-grounded primer on how to make sense of these important changes in relational life<br><br>Fully updated to reflect new developments in technology and digital scholarship, the book identifies the core relational issues these media disturb and shows how our talk about them echoes historical discussions about earlier communication technologies. Chapters explore how we use mediated language and nonverbal behavior to develop and maintain communities, social networks, and new relationships, and to maintain existing relationships in our everyday lives. The book combines research findings with lively examples to address questions such as: Can mediated interaction be warm and personal? Are people honest about themselves online? Can relationships that start online work? Do digital media damage the other relationships in our lives? Throughout, the book argues that these questions must be answered with firm understandings of media qualities and the social and personal contexts in which they are developed and used.<br><br>This new edition of <i>Personal Connections in the Digital Age</i> will be required reading for all students and scholars of media, communication studies, and sociology, as well as all those who want a richer understanding of digital media and everyday life.</p></p><p>Nancy K.

The seafood supplier didn&#x2019;t communicate that he was selling fresher salmon with longer shelf life, and thus enhancing his customers&#x2019; bottom lines, until a competitor threatened his market share. <br><br>You could be providing a lot of extras to your customers without realizing how much you are actually saving them. Or, if you do not provide meaningful extras now, you might consider adopting them. They can be critical competitive advantages. Consider the following: <br><br><b>Terms.</b> I f you are a small or medium-size company up against a category killer, you might have flexible financing terms that the big guys can&#x2019;t match. For example, a lumber company in the Northeast enjoyed a robust business with little substantial competition until Home Depot began to close in. One Home Depot box opened twenty miles away, and then another just ten miles down the road. Observers predicted that the lumber company would soon be bulldozed out of business. <br><br>Surely, it couldn&#x2019;t compete on price, not against Home Depot &#x2019;s buying power. Lumber is lumber. So it concentrated on hitting Home Depot where it was vulnerable. It offered more - flexible credit arrangements for its most important customers&#x2013;small contractors who often lack lines of credit from banks. The lumber company didn&#x2019;t have to drop its prices to stay in business. It adopted new competitive advantages. <br><br><b>Guarantees.</b> It is common for attendees at my seminars to tell me that their companies are &#x201c;the only ones in our industry offering multi-year guarantees&#x201d; on their products. But when I ask if they make a big deal about the guarantee to prospective buyers, most admit they do not. <br><br>The reason is usually the same: &#x201c;If we emphasize the guarantee, too many customers may take advantage of it.&#x201d; <br><br>That&#x2019;s a pretty lame excuse. Either you offer a guarantee or you don&#x2019;t. If you are confident enough in the product to guarantee it in the first place, make a selling point of it. Statistics show that a very small percentage of customers in any business actually use the guarantee. But the guarantee takes a lot of risk out of the buying decision and clinches a lot of deals. <br><br><b>Inventory turns.</b> One of my favorite stories about inventory turns involves a clothing manufacturer who sold women&#x2019;s clothes to boutiques around the country. When I asked him what differentiated him from his competitors, he said he thought his clothes were &#x201c;wearable.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;As opposed to what?&#x201d; I asked, trying not to laugh. He began to talk about design, fabric, cut, and so on. When I queried what his competitors we re saying, he shrugged and said, &#x201c;I suppose the same thing . . . but I know my stuff sells much better.&#x201d; <br><br>I asked him what his customer, the boutique owner, cares about most. &#x201c;Whether or not it sells,&#x201d; he said. So I asked if his shop owners measured inventory turns. He answered that some did, some did not. I suggested that he teach them how to measure inventory turns and then he could prove to the shop owners his clothes sold better. <br>My point was that he should stop selling &#x201c;wearable clothes&#x201d; like everyone else and start selling inventory turns. Moving the goods is what matters. <br><br>Note: Be sure you can back up your boast. Your buyers will know soon enough if you can&#x2019;t. As with any competitive advantage you claim, make sure you deliver. <br><br><b>Materials.</b> One client in the home-improvement business who sold siding knew his product was &#x201c;stronger and better&#x201d; because of the materials he used. But he didn&#x2019;t know how to convey that without sounding biased and subjective. Upon asking his employees a series of questions I learned from one of his engineers that the company&#x2019;s product has a higher wind load rating than any competitive product. In many geographic markets, the higher load rating influences buying decisions. So if your materials are stronger and provide customers with a benefit, shout about it in a way that is measurable. <br><br><b>Delivery</b>. I f you provide the same product as your competitors but you offer better delivery service, you have a competitive advantage. But how important is it? The Compleat Company, which sells promotional products, decided to find out. The Seattle-based company polled its customers about the importance of its on-time delivery. It found that its customers not only valued that service highly, they had a pretty low tolerance for being late. <br><br>Eighty-eight percent of its customers defined &#x201c;on-time delivery&#x201d; as being on schedule 97 percent of the time or better. Only 4 percent of its customers would accept an on-schedule rate of less than 93 percent. A manager from Compleat told me that the company is now focusing its energy and resources to make sure it meets that expectation. When Compleat&#x2019;s customers want their deliveries, they will get them. <br><br><b>Information.</b> In business as in war, intelligence can be priceless. In <i>Business @ the Speed of Though</i>t (Warner, 1999), Bill Gates writes: &#x201c;The most meaningful way to differentiate your company from your competition, the best way to put distance between you and the crowd, is to do an outstanding job with information. How you gather, manage, and use information will determine whether you win or lose.&#x201d; <br><br>Knowing what your competitors are doing, and keeping up with trends in your industry, are basic forms of intelligence, and essential if you are going to run a successful business. So is listening to your customers. (Your own and your competitors&#x2019;.) <br><br>The more competitive the business you are in, the more important the role of intelligence. You can&#x2019;t afford to get caught fl a t footed if, say, a labor strike shuts off deliveries of critically needed material. Or if commodity prices suddenly spike or drop. Or consumer confidence sinks. Or if new products being developed by your competitors threaten your markets. <br><br>No matter what business you are in, failing to keep a weather eye on changes in your industry can be fatal. A lot of this &#x201c;intelligence&#x201d; is hardly proprietary. It simply amounts to smart business practices born out of experience. If you are a B-to-B supplier who sells to retailers, your customers&#x2019; success determines how well you do, too. Your experience can help your clients avoid common mistakes. <br><br>Small and medium-size businesses are often in the dark about key developments in their industries. They lack the time, money, and expertise to gather and evaluate that information. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean it isn&#x2019;t important. Consider the prices they pay for the goods or services they buy. Advance word of radical price shifts, or new products that will make others obsolete, can save them from missing a buying opportunity, or from laying in inventory that will soon become obsolete. <br><br>Keeping your customers informed of trends can only make them healthier, and in turn create more business for you. Word of mouth from your sales force is one time-honored way to accomplish this. But in this age of t h e Internet there are other effective ways, too, from e-mail to Web sites that keep clients posted on prices and other industry developments. <br><br>One of my former clients, the Institute for Trend Research, in Concord, New Hampshire, analyzes market and economic trends and makes accurate predictions as to when those trends will change. Its business is its forecasting expertise in a wide range of sectors, from industrial construction and agricultural market movement to interest rates, commodity prices, and inflation. <br><br>Subscribers to the company&#x2019;s publication <i>EcoTrends</i> get an important bonus: a discount on EcoCharts. EcoCharts, using raw data that the subscribers provide themselves, tells them which indicators included in <i>EcoTrends</i> correlate c o r relate best to their specific businesses. ITR has defined four phases of economic movement; if t h e t rends that affect your industry are in Phase C, then you are expecting a downturn. Your actions might include a reduction in inventory and training, an avoidance of long-term purchase commitments, and deeper concentration on your cash and balance sheet. On the other hand, during Phase B, an upward trend, you would accelerate training, increase prices, consider outside manufacturing, and open distribution centers. This kind of information can provide companies with powerful competitive advantages. <br><br><b>Training.</b> Many large companies offer specialized training for their customers, free or at cost, so they can run their business better. McDonald&#x2019;s runs its own academy for new franchise owners, for example, so they can learn to avoid common pitfalls and maximize the return on their investments. The company draws on the experiences of thousands of other franchise owners and shares that knowledge, because it is vital to their own business. I often recommend to clients that if they invest heavily in training they should make a competitive point of it. For example, &#x201c;We invest half a million dollars each year training our employees&#x201d; or &#x201c;. . . training our customers.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Allergen-Free Baker&#39;s Handbook</h2><p><b>Free to Eat Sweets!<br><br></b>The number of people with food allergies is skyrocketing, leaving puzzled cooks and anxious parents eager to find recipes for &#x201c;normal&#x201d; foods that are both safe <i>and</i> delicious. <i>The Allergen-Free Baker&#x2019;s Handbook</i> features 100 tried-and-true recipes that are completely free of all ingredients responsible for 90 percent of food allergies, sparing bakers the all-too-common frustration of having to make unsatisfactory substitutions or rework recipes entirely.

In her clingy dresses and dangling earrings she exuded a sexuality at odds with the innocence projected by the unicorn posters on her walls. While her embittered mother fretted about her welfare from her home in London, in Cambridge&#x2014;where Elena was a student at St. Stephen's College&#x2014;her father and his second wife each had their own very different image of the girl.

But unlike most, her choices may determine whether she lives or dies. At 13, an orphan, and unhappily married, Miyax runs away from her husband's parents' home, hoping to reach San Francisco and her pen pal. But she becomes lost in the vast Alaskan tundra, with no food, no shelter, and no idea which is the way to safety. Now, more than ever, she must look hard at who she really is. Is she Miyax, Eskimo girl of the old ways? Or is she Julie (her "gussak"-white people-name), the modernized teenager who must mock the traditional customs? And when a pack of wolves begins to accept her into their community, Miyax must learn to think like a wolf as well. If she trusts her Eskimo instincts, will she stand a chance of surviving? John Schoenherr's line drawings suggest rather than tell about the compelling experiences of a girl searching for answers in a bleak landscape that at first glance would seem to hold nothing.

Those plans were complicated by the outbreak of World War II and the call of duty. Assigned to the HMS <i>Warspite</i>, a formidable 30,000-ton battleship, Surgeon Lieutenant O'Reilly soon found himself face-to-face with the hardships of war, tending to the dreadnought's crew of 1,200 as well as to the many casualties brought aboard.</p><p>Life in Ballybuckebo is a far cry from the strife of war, but over two decades later O'Reilly and his younger colleagues still have plenty of challenges: an outbreak of German measles, the odd tropical disease, a hard-fought pie-baking contest, and a local man whose mule-headed adherence to tradition is standing in the way of his son's future. Now older and wiser, O'Reilly has prescriptions for whatever ails...until a secret from the past threatens to unravel his own peace of mind.</p><p>Shifting deftly between two very different eras, Patrick Taylor's latest Irish Country novel reveals more about O'Reilly's tumultuous past, even as Ballybucklebo faces the future in its own singular fashion.</p></p><p><p>PATRICK TAYLOR, M.D., was born and raised in Bangor, County Down, in Northern Ireland.

He now lives on Saltspring Island, British Columbia.</p><p>1</p> <p><i>A Rose by Any Other Name</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Someone was ringing the front doorbell of Number One, Main Street, and insistently at that. Doctor Fingal Flaherty O&#x2019;Reilly was eating a solitary lunch of cold roast ham, hard-boiled eggs, and salad while his partner, Doctor Barry Laverty, was out on an emergency home visit. &#x201c;Coming,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly roared, put down his knife and fork and, grabbing his sports jacket from the back of a chair, headed for the front hall. His housekeeper, Kinky Kincaid, usually answered the door but today she was preparing for her wedding the following day.</p> <p>The noon sun brightened the afternoon, but even its late-April radiance could add little lustre to the full vestments of Mister Robinson, the Presbyterian minister, who stood at the doorway wringing his hands. His rusty black robes, O&#x2019;Reilly thought, made the man look like a dishevelled crow. &#x201c;Yes, Your Reverence? What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Doctor, can you come across to the church at once? Please?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Somebody sick?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly asked, shrugging into his jacket. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get my bag.&#x201d; He turned, but was forestalled by the minister grabbing an arm.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s sick, but the war of the roses is breaking out in my church. There&#x2019;s a row and a ructions, and I don&#x2019;t know what to do. Please come. If anybody in Ballybucklebo can stop it, it&#x2019;s you.&#x201d; He turned, trotted down the short gravelled drive, and was forced by a lorry heading from Bangor to Belfast to wait for O&#x2019;Reilly to catch up. As soon as there was a gap in the traffic, the minister hurried across the road to the church with O&#x2019;Reilly trailing behind.</p> <p>&#x201c;What row?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly asked, catching his breath as they passed under the lych-gate.</p> <p>&#x201c;Maggie Houston and Flo Bishop.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who? Maggie and Flo?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly frowned as they passed into the shadow of the old yews in the graveyard. &#x201c;But they&#x2019;re old friends, for G&#x2014;&#x201d; Better not say &#x201c;God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d; His frown deepened. &#x201c;I think,&#x201d; he said, stopping in his tracks, &#x201c;you&#x2019;d better explain before we go in.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mister Robinson sighed. &#x201c;The ladies of the Women&#x2019;s Guild take it in turns on a weekly rota to look after decorating the church for services and ceremonies. Maggie Houston&#x2019;s on the duty this week. Because we all know Kinky&#x2019;s fondness for wildflowers, Maggie&#x2019;s got them by the great gross&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;For the wedding tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Correct, but Flo Bishop, being matron of honour, even though it&#x2019;s not her turn to do the flowers, has assumed responsibility for decorating the church with hothouse roses because she says Kinky deserves the very best. She&#x2019;s formed a subcommittee with Aggie Arbuthnot and Cissie Sloan. Maggie whipped up support from Jeannie Jingles and Alice Moloney and&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And you have two regiments going at it hammer and tongs? The wildflower fusiliers and the red-rose rifles, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right. Mrs. Bishop and her gang have commandeered the communion table and choir area and Maggie and their friends have placed themselves strategically&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Say no more.&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly, while being sympathetic to the minister&#x2019;s dilemma, was having great difficulty controlling an enormous grin. &#x201c;Lead on, Macduff,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is something I&#x2019;ve got to see.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you, Doctor. They won&#x2019;t listen to me. But you&#x2019;ll make them see sense.&#x201d;</p> <p>O&#x2019;Reilly followed the minister until they reached the nave, where the perfume of flowers was overpowering even the dust of two hundred years that usually haunted the old building.</p> <p>On Maggie&#x2019;s side, heaps of freshly plucked wildflowers were piled on the front pew. Roses on the opposite side of the aisle formed Flo Bishop&#x2019;s ammunition dump.</p> <p>The two groups, led by their respective champions, stood facing each other at the top of the nave.</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do no such thing, Maggie MacCorkle&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Mrs. Houston to you, Mrs. Bishop.&#x201d;</p> <p>Both women stood facing each other, arms akimbo, eyes afire, leaning forward, chins jutting. Flo&#x2019;s teeth were clenched and there she had Maggie Houston n�e MacCorkle at a disadvantage. The older woman wasn&#x2019;t wearing her false ones, and clenched gums were less than threatening.</p> <p>Lord, O&#x2019;Reilly thought, harking back to his boxing days, <i>And in the blue corner at one hundred and eighty pounds&nbsp;&#x2026; </i>&#x201c;Ladies,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Ladies, whatever seems to be the trouble?&#x201d;</p> <p>He could make no sense of all the women&#x2019;s voices speaking at once, but made a shrewd guess about what was being said.</p> <p>&#x201c;All right, all right,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;now settle down. <i>Settle down</i>.&#x201d; He waited as Flo smoothed her dress as a just-pecked mallard duck would waggle her tail feathers.</p> <p>Maggie adjusted her hat. It had a single wilted bluebell in its brim.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can we not sort this out like the civilised people we are?&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>Flo glowered at Maggie. Maggie folded her arms across her chest. Their supporters closed ranks behind their principals.</p> <p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly, &#x201c;let me see if I can get this straight. Maggie. <i>Maggie</i>?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You and your friends love Kinky and you want her day to be perfect, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We do, so we do, <i>but,</i>&#x201d; Maggie turned her frowning face sideways to Flo Bishop, &#x201c;thon Flo&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>O&#x2019;Reilly cut her off. &#x201c;Flo, you and Aggie and Cissie feel the same way but think you know a better way to make Kinky&#x2019;s wedding day shine?&#x201d;</p> <p>Flo glowered and said, &#x201c;Me and the ladies do love Kinky and she told me that on the night Archie proposed he give her red roses and <i>that&#x2019;s</i> why&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>O&#x2019;Reilly cut her off too. He wanted no more petrol poured on the flames. &#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;whoa, calm down and pay attention, the lot of you.&#x201d; It wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to throw his weight around just a little bit at the beginning. Take control. &#x201c;Now listen. I think I know Kinky Kincaid better than anyone in the village and townland. Wouldn&#x2019;t you all agree?&#x201d;</p> <p>Subdued murmuring of assent.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good. And just so we&#x2019;re all clear, can we agree again that we love Kinky?&#x201d;</p> <p>Flo scowled at Maggie, who scowled right back.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ladies?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly put an edge of steel in his voice. &#x201c;Are we all agreed?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; Cissie Sloan said. &#x201c;I mind the day she first come til the village, so I do. No harm til you, Doctor dear, but it was way before your time, sir. It was a Wednesday&#x2014;no, I tell a lie it was a Friday, and she&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>First defection on Flo&#x2019;s side, O&#x2019;Reilly thought, but let&#x2019;s not have Cissie ramble on too much.</p> <p>&#x201c;Houl your wheest, Cissie Sloan,&#x201d; Jeannie Jingles said, but with a smile. &#x201c;We all remember her coming and it doesn&#x2019;t matter a jot or tittle exactly when. What Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly says is true. There&#x2019;s not a woman in the whole townland more widely respected.&#x201d;</p> <p>A breakaway from solidarity with Maggie. &#x201c;And what,&#x201d; said O&#x2019;Reilly, &#x201c;if the respected Kinky was a fly on the wall here today. What do you reckon she&#x2019;d be thinking about all these silly selfish schoolgirl shenanigans?&#x201d;</p> <p>He waited, quite prepared to re-ask the question, but Cissie had started the rent in the fabric of Flo&#x2019;s group.</p> <p>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; said Aggie Arbuthnot, tearing it further, &#x201c;she&#x2019;d be sad to see her friends falling out over nothing, and,&#x201d; her voice cracked, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d not want for Kinky to be unhappy about nothing on her wedding day.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;It would be a right shame if she was, so it would.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re dead on, Aggie.&#x201d; Jeannie Jingles spoke for the opposition. &#x201c;You just said a mouthful.&#x201d; She smiled.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you my twopenny&#x2019;s worth,&#x201d; said Alice Moloney. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t agree, and please let&#x2019;s not anybody get upset about that, but Kinky&#x2019;s a very sensible woman. I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;d be sad at all. I think she&#x2019;d be laughing like a drain at the lot of us going at it like a bull in a china shop&#x2014;and all because we want the very best for her. We&#x2019;re all daft.&#x201d; She turned to O&#x2019;Reilly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re like a bunch of kiddies. Thank you, Doctor, for helping us to see that.&#x201d;</p> <p>O&#x2019;Reilly inclined his head.</p> <p>&#x201c;Buck eejits,&#x201d; said Maggie very quietly, &#x201c;the whole lot of us, and I&#x2019;m sorry to have been so thran, so I am.&#x201d;</p> <p>A lovely Ulster word for &#x201c;bloody-minded,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly thought.</p> <p>Mister Robinson, who for the duration of the recent discussion had wisely, O&#x2019;Reilly thought, until now distanced himself from taking part, said, &#x201c;&#x2018;Bless�d are the peacemakers,&#x2019; Matthew five and nine.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;May I make a suggestion?&#x201d; O&#x2019;Reilly said.</p> <p>Maggie and Flo&#x2019;s &#x201c;Please do, sir&#x201d; was as one.</p> <p>&#x201c;Kinky&#x2019;s a country girl from County Cork. She&#x2019;s loved wildflowers all her life. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;d be delighted to have them at her wedding.&#x201d; From the tail of his eye he saw Maggie&#x2019;s grin start, so quickly added, &#x201c;But Flo has a point too. I remember well the night Archie asked me for Kinky&#x2019;s hand and the beautiful red roses he brought with the ring that evening. I think they&#x2019;d add a really romantic touch.&#x201d; Flo&#x2019;s smile kept Maggie&#x2019;s company. He waited.</p> <p>&#x201c;So why,&#x201d; said Maggie, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t we do both? If that&#x2019;s all right with you, Flo?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; said Flo, &#x201c;it is, Maggie, dear. We should have thought of that before, so we should.&#x201d; She turned to Mister Robinson. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry about all the fuss over nothing, sir.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfectly all right, now you&#x2019;ve kissed and made up,&#x201d; he said.</p> <p>&#x201c;And,&#x201d; said Maggie, &#x201c;once we&#x2019;re done, I think the six of us and,&#x201d; she hesitated then said, &#x201c;Mister Robinson and Doctor O&#x2019;Reilly if they&#x2019;d like, should all go home to my house for a wee cup of tea in our hands and,&#x201d; her toothless grin was enormous, &#x201c;none of youse&#x2019;ll go hungry. I just baked two plum cakes today, so I did.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That would be lovely,&#x201d; Flo said, &#x201c;wouldn&#x2019;t it, ladies?&#x201d;</p> <p>The other four women nodded in agreement.</p> <p>O&#x2019;Reilly caught the minister&#x2019;s eye. He&#x2019;d seen the same glazed look on the face of a rabbit cornered by a fox. Clearly Mister Robinson had experienced Maggie&#x2019;s stewed tea and cement-like fruitcake before and was searching desperately for an excuse so he could decline. O&#x2019;Reilly himself had no such hesitation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to come, Maggie. I haven&#x2019;t seen your cat, General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, nor Sonny&#x2019;s dogs for ages, but you&#x2019;ll understand a doctor&#x2019;s day is not his own?&#x201d; She and the others would at least think they did, and any doctor could claim being needed by the calls of his profession. &#x201c;But nothing, not a team of wild horses, will keep me from the wedding tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Ballybucklebo Stories Corp</p></p><h2>South of the Pumphouse</h2><p>A dark, clever tale of two brothers, a fishing trip, drugs, and murder, this novel skillfully combines classic motifs of epic struggle and intelligent layers of imagery, reminiscent of <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, and the raw, tweaked perspective of a Hunter S.

They toured the world with groups like Jane&#39;s Addiction, Public Enemy, and U2. Claypool penned the theme song to TV&#39;s &#34;South Park,&#34; and has guested on albums by many other artists, including Jerry Cantrell and Tom Waits.Brothers Ed and Earl Paxton are different mid-1990s products of the redneck California town El Sobrante: Earl, 36, is a meth-smoking greaser who stayed in town. Ed has tried to distance himself from his roots by going to state college, moving to Berkeley and marrying a black woman. His trip back to "ol' El Sob," prompted by nostalgic stirrings after his father dies, catapults him back to his past. The brothers leave on a fishing trip, and Ed is dismayed to discover that Earl's obnoxious friend, Donny Vowdy, a loquacious and flatulent man overflowing with stories of his sexual exploits, is along for the ride. While on the water, Earl is forced into the role of referee between Ed and Donny as the men, plied with beer, pot and psychedelic mushrooms, dredge up ancient arguments, but it is Earl's drug-fueled rampage that lands the brothers in trouble. Though Claypool, mostly known as the bass player in the band Primus, substitutes childhood flashbacks for character development and constructs a thin plot, his characters' escalating savagery culminates in a satisfyingly unsettling conclusion. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

First issued in 1903, it served in two world wars and the Korean War and numerous smaller military actions around the globe between in the first half of the 20th Century. It even saw limited service during the War in Vietnam. Today, it is an extremely popular and sought-after military rifle by collectors. A modification of the famous Mauser bolt action, The Model 1903 Springfield was legendary for its accuracy in the hands of a well-trained rifleman. A variation of the rifle developed especially for match shooting held the crown in the National Matches longer than any other rifle. The National Matches have been conducted annually on a nationwide basis since 1873&#x2014;except in wartime&#x2014;and involved both civilian and military shooters competing on an equal basis. The matches exerted a great deal of influence on the design of American military rifles and marksmanship training. </p><p> &#x201c;The Model 1903 Springfield Rifle and its Variations&#x201d; provides a detailed examination of this famous military rifle on a part-by-part basis. Every variation in every part is documented and matched to the serial number range of its use. Thirty-one different variations of the rifle were developed over the 41 year course of its production and all are described and identified. </p><p> Twelve different variations of the rifles were developed as sniper rifles beginning in 1907. All are discussed and described as are the telescopic sights used on each. The rifle was produced for civilian shooters by the Springfield national armory as well. Several variations of .30 caliber rifles were developed and sold through the Director, Civilian Marksmanship Program and the National Rifle Association for target shooting and hunting. A range of .22 caliber rimfire rifles was also developed for both low cost military and civilian marksmanship training in the 1920s and 1930s. </p><p> During World War II, to meet the needs of a 12 million man military force, the Remington Arms Company and the Smith Corona Typewriter Company produced more than 1.8 million Model 1903A3 rifles including the Remington-manufactured Model 1903A4 sniper rifle. </p><p> Appendices provide additional information on serial numbers, production numbers by month for all variations including the Model 1903A3 and Model 1903A4, ammunition, inspection procedures and markings, lists of military and civilian inspectors and their markings, the National Match rifle and the rare and highly classified Pedersen device that converted this bolt action rifle to a semiautomatic rifle during World War I with never-before published original factory photos. A thorough bibliography completes the text. </p><p> &#x201c;The Model 1903 Springfield Rifle and its Variations,&#x201d; is the fifteenth book in the North Cape Publication&#x2019;s &#x201c;For Collectors Only&#x201d; series for beginning and advanced firearm&#x2019;s collectors and the twenty-third book on their list.

Porter explores medicine's evolution against the backdrop of the wider religious, scientific, philosophical, and political beliefs of the culture in which it develops, covering ground from the diseases of the hunter-gatherers to today's threat of AIDS and ebola, from the clearly defined conviction of the Hippocratic oath to the muddy ethical dilemmas of modern-day medicine. Offering up a treasure trove of historical surprises along the way, this book "has instantly become the standard single-volume work in its field" (<em>The Lancet</em>). "The author's perceptiveness is, as usual, scalpel-sharp; his manner genially bedside; his erudition invigorating." - Simon Schama 24 pages of b/w illustrations</p><p>Samuel Johnson once called the medical profession "the greatest benefit to mankind." In the 20th century, the quality of that benefit has improved more and more rapidly than at any other comparable time in history. With all the capabilities of modern medicine's practicioners, however, we as a people are as worried about our health as ever.<p> Roy Porter, a social historian of medicine the London's Wellcome Institute, has written an dauntingly thick history of how medical thinking and practice has risen to the challenges of disease through the centuries. But delve into its pages, and you'll find one marvelous bit of history after another. The obvious highlights are touched upon--Hippocrates introduces his oath, Pasteur homogenizes, Jonas Salk produces the polio vaccine, and so on--but there's also Dr. Francis Willis's curing of <i>The Madness of King George</i>, W. T. G. Morton's hucksterish use of ether in surgery, and research on digestion conducted using a man with a stomach fistula (if you don't know what that means, you may not <i>want</i> to know). Porter is straightforward about his deliberate focus on Western medical traditions, citing their predominant influence on global medicine, and with <i>The Greatest Benefit to Mankind</i>, he has produced a volume worthy of that tradition's legacy.</p>&#34;The Greatest Benefit to Mankind&#34; was shortlisted for the 1998 National Book Critics Circle General Nonfiction Award.</p><h2>Charlatan: America&#39;s Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam</h2><p>The inspiration for the 2016 Sundance Film Festival documentary, <i>NUTS!</i>. &#x201c;An extraordinary saga of the most dangerous quack of all time...entrancing&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>USA Today </i><br><br> In 1917, John R. Brinkley&#x2013;America&#x2019;s most brazen con man&#x2013;introduced an outlandish surgical method for restoring fading male virility. <br><br> It was all nonsense, but thousands of eager customers quickly made &#x201c;Dr.&#x201d; Brinkley one of America&#x2019;s richest men&#x2013;and a national celebrity. The great quack buster Morris Fishbein vowed to put the country&#x2019; s &#x201c;most daring and dangerous&#x201d; charlatan out of business, yet each effort seemed only to spur Brinkley to new heights of ingenuity, and the worlds of advertising, broadcasting, and politics soon proved to be equally fertile grounds for his potent brand of flimflam. <br><br> Culminating in a decisive courtroom confrontation, <i>Charlatan</i> is a marvelous portrait of a boundlessly audacious rogue on the loose in an America ripe for the bamboozling.</p><p>POPE BROCK&nbsp;has written for numerous publications, including <i>Rolling Stone, Esquire, GQ</i>, and the <i>London Sunday Times Magazine</i>.

Located in Des Moines, Fort Wayne, East St. Louis, and other towns throughout the Midwest, they were devoted to the documentation and cure of "men's secret diseases." Most had big display windows facing the street, and what the Reinhardts put in those windows was the talk of the industry. Their most celebrated exhibit, in Minneapolis, was entitled "The Dying Custer."<br><br>He lay like Saint Sebastian, bristling with arrows, in a lavish three-dimensional tableau. Redskins, corpses, and plaster vultures added richness to the scene, but what kept passersby bunched at the window, staring in for minutes on end, was the slow, rhythmic heaving of Custer's chest. They gazed till their own breathing fell into sync--it was irresistible--and that gave the Reinhardts' message time to go to work. True, Custer's connection to impotence may have been largely metaphorical, but to a certain fretful portion of the populace it struck home. Power gone, youth destroyed--but not yet, not quite yet. Inside this building there was even hope for Yellow Hair.<br><br>Mixing terror and hope was the Reinhardts' stock-in-trade. Their window in Gary, Indiana--again designed by their visionary house artist, Monsieur Brouillard--featured a diorama of a doctor and nurse trying to save a syphilitic baby with the help of a wheezing resuscitator. But displays alone, no matter how artful, didn't make the Reinhardt twins tops in their field. From their headquarters at the Vienna Medical Institute in Chicago, where they rode herd on some three dozen franchises, they enforced levels of standardization and quality control remarkably ahead of their time. Starting with their training of salesmen: nobody worked for the Reinhardts without first graduating from the "instantaneous medical college" at the home office. This was followed by more training at the Gary branch, where each recruit was given a white coat, asked to grow a Vandyke, and made to practice his patter as if it were Gilbert and Sullivan. Only then were real customers released upon them. Serving as exhibition guides, the floor men were expected to nail twenty percent of all prospects--eight out of an average forty walk-ins a day--or look for another job. The manager of each institute sent headquarters a daily financial report in triplicate.<br><br>Admission was free at all these places. The abba-dabba juice was not. Bottles of it were on sale at the exit, a fabled elixir guaranteed to soothe, stimulate, inflate, reinstate, backdate, laminate, and in general make "the withered bough quicken and grow green again," while at the same time curing and/or preventing the clap; it adapted to the needs of the customer. What was in it? What was in any of them? What was in Dr. Raphael's Cordial Invigorant, America's first big virility tonic in the 1850s, whose royal Arabian formula was made vastly more potent by the "magical influence of modern Astrologers"? What was the recipe for Baume de Vie, Elixir Renovans, the Syrop Vitae of Anthony Bellou, the Glorious Spagyric of Jone Case, or any of the others in lands and ages stretching back to the dawn of time? For the record, the Reinhardts' tonic contained three ingredients--alcohol, sugar, and a dash of "Aqua Missourianas quantitat sufficiat ad cong II"--but this is pedantry.<br><br>Big as they were, the Reinhardts still had plenty of competition. Independents with similar rackets were out there grubbing in the twilight, men like Dr. Burke of Knoxville, Tennessee, who in 1907 was running his own small shop with the help of an assistant, Dr. John Brinkley.<br><br>Young Brinkley was a likely lad of twenty-two. To call him a doctor was, in the strictest sense, inaccurate, but if the white coat reassured people, the healing had begun. In truth he was the floor man and he worked on commission. Brinkley would study a prospect as he came through the door, then materialize--not too soon--at his elbow. The young physician chatted, he chuckled, he took a grave interest; he showed the man around. Soon the two were passing along the main line of exhibits: a stage-by-stage depiction of the male member in syphilitic decline. It spoke for itself. With each new cabinet the organ grew more deformed and the colors changed. Perhaps leprosy was mentioned by way of comparison.<br><br>In the last room the customer met The Boy.<br><br>It was known by that name throughout the trade, and every "free educational anatomical institute" worth its salt had one. The scene was replayed countless times: while the salesman hung back, or bent to tie his shoe, the customer approached a rectangular pillar walled in glass. It was pitch-dark inside. The mark moved toward it cautiously, perhaps glancing back at his guide for the go-ahead, peered in close trying to see what was in there--and then the lights blazed on full, and the grinning wax face of an idiot sprang into view. Horrifying as it was, the warning above it was even worse:<br><br>LOST MANHOOD<br><br>The customer knew then that he wasn't just looking at a vile mask with dripping yellow eyes. He was looking at the future. He was looking at himself.<br><br>After this bit of venereal kabuki--"the convincer," in quack talk--the rest was usually easy. As Dr. Burke sat at a desk, possibly lost in a medical tome, Dr. Brinkley brought the poor sinner forward and introduced him. Burke gave him an "instant consultation" ("Are you ever thirsty?" "Do you sometimes suffer from fatigue?"--warning signs all) and produced a bottle of peerless tonic, which the man was assured would save his organ and probably his life. The price was almost as big a shock as The Boy, between ten and twenty dollars, but who in his right mind would economize at a time like this? Moments later the customer was standing in the alley with the hooey in his hand and the door shut firmly behind him.<br><br>How much satisfaction Brinkley felt at such moments is unknown. The greatest quacks never gloat for long; when deception is the drug, there's no building up a supply. Besides, he had so much ambition that working in two tatty rooms with a substandard Boy could have been depressing at times.<br><br>On the other hand, he might have taken pride in having gotten so far so young. Brinkley came from the tiny town of Beta, North Carolina, tucked in the Great Smokies not far from the Tennessee line. Like his neighbors, he grew up on a hilly little farm that produced mostly rocks. He ate mush and greens and lashed gunnysacks to his feet for winter boots. The thick forests and hard climbs, the rainy days when bowls of fog gathered in the valleys, the strangers scarce as hen's teeth: all this conspired to make the outside world seem little more than a rumor, so it was natural that most people, if they started out there, stayed put.<br><br>Not Brinkley. "Kind of a recklesslike boy," one neighbor called him. "Lively as a cricket," another said. And all the while he burned with a bitter fire, and he dreamed. ("I thought of John Brinkley freeing the slaves," he said later, "John Brinkley illuminating the world, John Brinkley facing an assassin's bullet for the sake of his people, John Brinkley healing the sick.") But with the slaves freed, the world lit, and nobody caring enough about him to kill him, he chose number four--sort of. First he married Sally Wike, a spitfire from a neighboring farm, as eager as he was to escape the prison of the mountains. Then "he got up a little play," as Mrs. Ann Bennett, who boarded them briefly, recalled it, "and he and his wife and some more people went on the road from town to town, you know, giving little plays."<br><br>He sang and he danced and he healed. Barely twenty, Brinkley got his precocious start touring as a type of medicine man known as a Quaker doctor. Though, in the general run of Quakers, specialty numbers were almost unknown, some itinerant quacks in those days liked to impersonate them, trading on their legendary rectitude. Some folks saw through the act, but it hardly mattered. Fooling some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time was plenty.<br><br>They usually performed at night. A platform was unfolded and torches placed at each corner as the audience gathered, drawn by handbills and word of mouth. While there is no specific record of a Brinkley performance, there was a set pattern to most Quaker-doctor shows. First a fiddler or a dancer got the crowd warmed up. A short morality play followed, in which a noble head of house or ringleted female died pathetically for lack of a miracle tonic, identified by name. Finally the physician himself (Brinkley) shot onstage in a dinner-plate hat, cutaway coat, and pious pants that buttoned up the sides, theeing and thouing, singing and selling, waving a bottle of Ayer's Cathartic Pills. Or maybe Burdock Blood Bitters or Aunt Fanny's Worm Candy. One thing was for sure, whatever it was cured whatever you had.<br><br>With his unerring nose for where the money was, Brinkley had already become an American archetype: the quack on the boards. For in our nation with its special genius for swindle--where swampland, beefsteak mines, and tickets to nonexistent attractions practically sell themselves--medical fraud had always been the king of cons. At the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, a man dressed as a cowboy appeared onstage and strangled rattlesnakes by the dozen. He called what came out of them snake oil. People bought it.<br><br>Of course quacks have flourished in all ages and cultures, for nothing shows reason the door like cures for things. Unlike most scams, which target greed, quackery fires deeper into Jungian universals: our fear of death, our craving for miracles. When we see night approaching, nearly all of us are rubes.<br><br>Still, there has probably never been a more quack-prone and quack-infested country than the United States. Flocking west with the pioneers, they struck in one town, vanished to the next, and taught their tricks to others. Dupes were as common as passenger pigeons. Many Americans viewed hospitals, sometimes with justice, as tricked-up funeral homes and doctors as crooks who had a financial stake in keeping them sick.<br><br>But quacks weren't just accepted; they were joyously embraced, thanks to a perverse seam in the American mind stretching back almost to the dawn of the republic.<br><br>It first appeared in the early nineteenth century. In the heady days of Jacksonian democracy, that delirious celebration of the ordinary, the nation's elite--preachers, doctors, lawyers--were overthrown (at least mentally) with an abandon reminiscent of the French Revolution. Suddenly, to be educated was to be despised. Now, when it came to physicians, Americans not only tolerated but demanded incompetence. So high was the common man exalted that state governments, all but three, actually repealed licensing requirements for doctors. In midcentury educator Lemuel Shattuck, asked by the Massachusetts legislature to conduct a sanitary survey of that state, reported back: "Any one, male or female, learned or ignorant, an honest man or a knave, can assume the name of physician, and 'practice' upon any one, to cure or to kill, as either may happen, without accountability. It's a free country!"<br><br>The result of all this deregulation was the quack equivalent of the Oklahoma Land Rush, with effects that lasted for generations to come. Legitimate doctors had difficulty fighting back, their own record being spotty at best. Take Dr. Benjamin Rush, friend to the founders, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and by common consent the father of American medicine, who for many years after his death remained the nation's best-known physician. Hardworking, honest, a man who took his role as medical counselor to the nation seriously, he was also a virtual death machine, as grossly misguided as he was sincere. Rush favored bombing the body with mercury-laced calomel (which caused rampant diarrhea, bleeding of the gums, and uncontrolled drooling), blistering with hot irons (pain to no purpose), tobacco-smoke enemas, and bleeding by the pint. Some remember him today as the man who murdered George Washington, albeit unintentionally. Of course every evil has its upside: thanks in part to men like Rush, degenerative diseases of the heart, liver, kidneys, and so forth were almost unknown because so few people lived long enough to contract them.<br><br>So just who were the quacks? In this melee of plagues and poisons did it even matter? Granted, the people who bought pills against earthquakes were probably wasting their money, but when a man like Elisha Perkins (a contemporary of Dr. Rush) came along with his "galvanic tractors," fussing over the body with some hocus-pocus and two metal rods, at least he held with Hippocrates and did no harm. Like Dr. Rush, Dr. Perkins believed in what he was doing. Both were wrong, yet the one was honored and the other condemned. Given history like this, it becomes easier to understand why the people John Brinkley played to--especially the sick and frightened--were willing to give that youngster onstage the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>Confederates passed through the crowd laden with bottles of medicine for sale, while he cried up its vitalizing force, efficacious effluvium, and low, low price.<br><br>"All sold out, Doctor!"<br><br>"Bless you, my friends!"<br><br>The little troupe disbanded within a few months, and Brinkley never sang or danced for the rest of his career. Though he learned some important lessons, which he would later apply on the world stage, he was a faux scientist of the twentieth century, not a clown of the nineteenth. Working for Dr. Burke, his next step, at least put him in the right coat. But like his early role model, Abraham Lincoln, his ambition was a little engine that knew no rest, and in 1908 Brinkley moved on again, heading north this time toward the big city.<br>2<br><br>One thing at least would have been familiar: the fog that dragged, Smoky Mountain-style, across the grain elevators along the Chicago River. Some days it swallowed up portions of the city. It settled in doorways and ballooned slowly from passageways and alleys, mixing with steam and coal smoke, through which pedestrians burst as if out of a dream.<br><br>The city threw light at the problem. Along with snake oil, its recent world's fair had showcased Edison's great breakthrough, and ever since then Chicago had been his best customer. It became a city, one resident said, of "incredibly long lanes of street-lamps, up and down the slopes; light everywhere; light lavished and wasted; as much candle-power used in a week as the whole nation once used in a year." And it was by this light, on an evening's prowl along the Gold Coast, that Brinkley first beheld the world he had always dreamed of.</p><h2>The Essence of Karate</h2><p>Gichin Funakoshi is a legendary figure and the founder of Shotokan karate, the most popular style of Japanese karate, with millions of practitioners worldwide. In <i>The Essence of Karate</i>, Funakoshi creates, in his own words, a narrative of modern karate. He explains the philosophical and spiritual underpinnings and includes memories of his own training, as well as recollections of other karate masters and the history of the martial art. He also discusses the importance of winning without fighting, and the reason why many great martial artists improve with age.<br>The preface has been contributed by Hirokazu Kanazawa, President of the Shotokan Karate-do International Federation (and Funakoshi&#x2019;s disciple). He fondly writes of his memories of Gichin Funakoshi during his youth and what he learned from the master. In the afterword, the founder's great-nephew, Gisho Funakoshi, shares previously unknown personal anecdotes about his "Uncle Funakoshi."</p><p><b>GICHIN FUNAKOSHI</b> (1868-1957) was one of karate&#x2019;s great masters. Born in Okinawa, the birthplace of karate, he began training in secret Okinawan martial arts as a child. In 1922, at the request of the Japanese government, he demonstrated the still-secret Okinawan arts of self-defense on the Japanese mainland, which led to karate's introduction to the rest of Japan and subsequently the rest of the world. Funakoshi devoted the remainder of his life to this traditional martial art and wrote several classics on the subject.</p><h2>Doom Towns: The People and Landscapes of Atomic Testing, A Graphic History (Graphic History Series)</h2><p>The history of atomic testing is usually told as a story about big technology, big science, and complex global politics. <em>Doom Towns: The People and Landscapes of Atomic Testing </em>explains critical technological developments and the policies that drove weapons innovation within the context of the specific environments and communities where testing actually took place. The book emphasizes the people who participated, protested, or were affected by atomic testing and explains the decision-making process that resulted in these people and places becoming the only locations and groups to actually experience nuclear warfare during the Cold War. The graphic history presents various viewpoints directly linked to primary sources that reveal the complexity and uncertainty of this history to readers, while also providing evidence and access to archives to help them explore this controversial topic further and to reach their own informed conclusions about this history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Andrew G.

He is a coauthor of <em>American Horizons</em> (OUP, 2010), author of <em>Counterculture Green</em> (2007) and <em>Collecting Nature</em> (2001), and a Principal Investigator on the Nevada Test Site Oral History Project. <br><br><strong>Kristian Purcell</strong> is an artist and illustrator based in Bedford, United Kingdom.<br><br>"Earth's vast deserts and ocean expanses are littered with the eerie, mysterious, and fearsome remains of the planetary nuclear weapons complex. <em>Doom Towns</em> offers a multi-layered, open-ended history that helps make sense of these places and the people who inhabited and worked in them." -- Mark Fiege , Wallace Stegner Chair in Western American Studies, Montana State University, <em>Edge Effects </em><p></p><br>"This book is a beautiful object and a profound tool. Kirk's graphic history of the Nevada Nuclear Test Site offers a singular vision that could only grow from his immersive decade-long collaboration with one place, its people, and contexts. Paying careful attention to oral histories, nature, and visual culture, Kirk exposes once obscured Cold War spaces to the stark clarity of desert light. Purcell's illustrations help to develop the powerful sense of empathy that is at the core of this book. <em>Doom Towns</em> provides a crucial new way to understand the legacy of the Cold War and the Atomic West--and of doing history through stories that come alive in your hands."--Jeffrey C. Sanders, <em>Washington State University</em><p></p><br>"Drawn from previously untapped archival material and personal experiences, Kirk's graphic history of atmospheric atomic testing builds on existing scholarship and enriches and enlivens the story of this fascinating period. His work humanizes the impact of science on all parties involved in our early nuclear defense policy and reminds us that what we see is not always what we get."--Congresswoman Dina Titus, <em>Professor Emeritus at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas</em> <br><p></p><br>"Despite geopolitical differences, the United States and other Cold War states all tested nuclear weapons in places indigenous people once called home. Kirk's deftly written and wonderfully illustrated <em>Doom Towns</em> draws on a rich array of interviews and images to reveal the lived history of atomic test sites. The result is a compelling graphic history of a time when worker safety, property rights, and the environment were sacrificed on the radioactive altar of national security."--Patrick McCray, <em>University of California, Santa Barbara</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Doom Towns</em> is extraordinary in every way: as a work of scholarship, as a pedagogical tool, and as an art object. From a thoughtful introduction to carefully curated documents, from haunting and beautiful illustrations to economical prose and a neat narrative arc, this book makes good on the promise of graphic history. It is a triumph that will grab readers--ranging from students to experts in the field--and force them to think about the unthinkable."--Ari Kelman, <em>Penn State</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Living Your Unlived Life: Coping with Unrealized Dreams and Fulfilling Your Purpose in the Second Half of Life</h2><p><b>The esteemed Jungian psychologist counsels on how to cope with feelings of failure or regret in the latter half of life and how to open to a more meaningful existence, even if outer circumstances cannot be changed.</b><br><br> In <i>Living Your Unlived Life</i>, the renowned therapist Robert A.

It&#x2019;s the perfect setting for Mary Minor &#x201c;Harry&#x201d; Haristeen to build a new work shed designed by her dear friend, local architect Gary Gardner. But the natural serenity is shattered when out of the blue, right in front of Harry and Deputy Cynthia Cooper, and in broad daylight, Gary is shot to death by a masked motorcyclist.<br> &nbsp;<br> Outraged by the brazen murder, Harry begins to burrow into her friend&#x2019;s past&#x2014;and unearths a pattern of destructive greed reaching far back into Virginia&#x2019;s post-Revolutionary history. When Harry finds incriminating evidence, the killer strikes again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Heedless of her own safety, Harry follows a trail of clues to a construction site in Richmond, where the discovery of mysterious remains has recently halted work. Aided as always by her loyal, if opinionated, companions, crime-solving cats Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, and Tee Tucker the Corgi, Harry hunts for a link between the decades-old dead, the recently violently deceased&#x2014;and ancient secrets that underlie everything. And while other deaths are narrowly averted in a flurry of fur, the killer remains at large&#x2014;ever more desperate and dangerous. The deep-rooted legacy of corruption that&#x2019;s been exposed can never be buried again. But if Harry keeps pursuing the terrible truth, she may be digging her own grave.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Probable Claws</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Series fans will know exactly what to expect: animals who talk to one another, [Rita Mae] Brown&#x2019;s personal views on an array of topics, and a healthy dose of Virginia history.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The animal crew, joined by a surprising new addition, is in rare form. . . .

Business has been good.&#x201d; Anne de Vault, the owner, glanced up as more customers entered the store as if to prove her point.<br><br>The store, finally settled in its new location, boasted good floor display space as well as wall bookcases. Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, Harry&#x2019;s two cats, and Tucker, the corgi, inspected the books closest to the floor.<br><br>&#x201c;No books on catnip,&#x201d; Pewter, the gray cat, complained.<br><br>&#x201c;Who would write about catnip?&#x201d; the dog wondered.<br><br>&#x201c;An herbalist,&#x201d; Pewter replied. &#x201c;Humans drink catnip tea. It&#x2019;s a waste of good dried leaves but they do drink it. Catnip is meant to be chewed, inhaled, and then rolled in.&#x201d; This was pronounced with authority.<br><br>Harry watched as customers picked up books, put some down, kept others. There was no accounting for taste.<br><br>&#x201c;Even the post office parking lot is full. I was lucky. Just as I pulled in here a big SUV, big as in big as the state of Illinois, pulled out. Before I start browsing, did my order for Susan come in?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Capability Brown. In,&#x201d; Anne replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Susan is getting as serious about gardening as she is about golf. Saw the book written by the Duchess of Rutland. Thought she&#x2019;d like it.&#x201d; Harry commented on one of her best friend&#x2019;s deepening interest in gardening, and who better to write about it than an Englishwoman?<br><br>The English excelled at gardening. Rich, poor, in-�between, they had the touch.<br><br>&#x201c;The book is enormous. Lots of photographs, drawings.&#x201d; Anne placed it on the counter.<br><br>&#x201c;Give me a minute to cruise. I need to find some other gifts and nothing is better than a book.&#x201d;<br><br>The door opened again.<br><br>Anne called out, &#x201c;Lisa, your books are in.&#x201d;<br><br>Lisa Roudabush, mid-thirties, medium height, was the director of the Albemarle County office of Nature First, a statewide environmental nonprofit. The headquarters was in Richmond but small offices were in every town with a university since the young were environmentally conscious.<br><br>Raynell Archer, Lisa&#x2019;s assistant, began to turn the card cylinder looking for clever cards. They had walked into the store together, both lingering.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry.&#x201d; Lisa smiled. &#x201c;Come to the office after you buy your books and I buy mine. Gary Gardner is almost finished and it&#x2019;s a terrific design.&#x201d;<br><br>Raynell, now looking at books displayed artfully on a table, added, &#x201c;Harry, the walls run diagonally.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do they?&#x201d; Harry was curious.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I need to go to his office to pick a few last plans, approve more drawings, but we are nearly finished.&#x201d; Lisa would be glad when the remodeling was over.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing a work shed for me. It&#x2019;s a gift from my husband. Isn&#x2019;t Gary fun to work with?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He is.&#x201d; Lisa looked out the large front windows, one of the best features of the store. &#x201c;Are we ever going to see the sun again?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Spring,&#x201d; Anne called from the counter. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s supposed to start snowing again tomorrow and on Christmas. A white �Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I tell myself winter can be beautiful but I never quite believe it.&#x201d; Lisa walked to the counter where Anne had piled up her ordered books.<br><br>Lisa took the first one off the pile, a history of architecture in Richmond. Nature First, while primarily an environmental group, also regularly joined forces with other nonprofits to save historic buildings. The organization was also keen on the epochs before colonization, even before human life.<br><br>Lisa licked her forefinger to turn the page.<br><br>&#x201c;My great-�aunt used to do that.&#x201d; Harry laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you telling me I&#x2019;m an old lady? I&#x2019;m younger than you,&#x201d; Lisa fired back as she turned another page.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yes you are,&#x201d; Harry replied, enjoying the exchange. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve only ever seen old people do that.&#x201d;<br><br>Lisa motioned Harry over. &#x201c;Look here. Pages always stick together. Licking my finger is easier than trying to slide my fingernail between pages or rubbing them together to pop them apart.&#x201d; She demonstrated her thesis then said, &#x201c;If I buy a book I have to leaf through it for a few pages, get a glimpse of it. Then I&#x2019;ll read it later.&#x201d;<br><br>Anne seconded this, adding, &#x201c;Harry, your Mixed Role Productions calendars are here, too. You&#x2019;re behind this year. Usually you order them in July.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;July?&#x201d; Raynell asked, having joined the others at the counter. &#x201c;Why order a calendar in July?&#x201d;<br><br>Harry replied, &#x201c;They run August to August. And they&#x2019;re eight and a quarter by five and a half inches so I can&#x2019;t overlook them. See? Perfect size. If I order them in July they arrive in time for August.&#x201d;<br><br>She removed shrink-�wrap from the black-covered calendar with silver lettering that read 2017&#x2013;�2018, then demonstrated. &#x201c;Big squares for each month, and then the days for the month are on lined pages, three days to a page. There&#x2019;s a monthly financial record, too. A special occasions page is opposite the month at a glance. I got hooked. Here. Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Harry, I can&#x2019;t take your calendar,&#x201d; Lisa demurred.<br><br>&#x201c;I always order extras. You use it for a month and you&#x2019;ll get hooked, too. And they aren&#x2019;t expensive, which is the best part.&#x201d;<br><br>Lisa took the light green&#x2013;�covered calendar offered her; they came in many colors. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry examined Lisa&#x2019;s books, read the titles on the spines. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see, Architecture in Richmond before 1800. Birding books and books on dinosaurs. Are you bringing them back? Nature First isn&#x2019;t bringing them back, are you? Have you found some DNA?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Funny you should bring that up. I believe the day will come when that happens. Look at the uproar over that perfectly preserved mastodon,&#x201d; Lisa replied.<br><br>&#x201c;No need to dig. Those are in the Senate,&#x201d; Harry kidded.<br><br>&#x201c;If you only knew some of the people we have to work with in the House of Delegates. They don&#x2019;t read. They deny what they don&#x2019;t know. They love to exercise their little bit of power. You&#x2019;d think they would at least read history and political theory. I always hope the level of intelligence is higher in Washington.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Lisa, I think the results speak for themselves.&#x201d; Harry shrugged.<br><br>Raynell, close to Lisa&#x2019;s age, piped up. &#x201c;They deny climate change. They fail to realize how significant the architecture is in parts of Richmond. It&#x2019;s maddening to work with such limited people. All they think about is their next election.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right about that,&#x201d; Lisa agreed as she closed the book about architecture. &#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t many really old buildings left since Richmond was burned in 1865. A few. They are so beautiful. The new stuff, not so much. But the scarcity means we must protect them, the detail alone on some of these structures is beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Marvella Lawson, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts power, has promised to take me to look at some of the newer things, including those under construction,&#x201d; Harry said.<br><br>&#x201c;We fought the demolition of the Kushner Building,&#x201d; Raynell said. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t do a bit of good. Big money. These tall buildings can interfere with nesting and the lights at night confuse migrating birds. Big money doesn&#x2019;t care about anything but more profit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Richmond doesn&#x2019;t have a good development plan. Charlottesville is even worse.&#x201d; Lisa sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m beginning to think they hire the architect who will build the ugliest thing ever, like the giant pickle in London.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is pretty awful,&#x201d; Harry agreed. &#x201c;I always think the English know better and now they are as bad as everyone else. Old London was so much prettier than New London.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they&#x2019;ve mucked up Philadelphia, too. That used to be such a unique environment. Now it looks like every other city.&#x201d; Raynell&#x2019;s voice carried a hint of venom.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you from Philadelphia?&#x201d; Harry asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I went to Swarthmore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, good school.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where did you go, Harry?&#x201d; Raynell asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Smith.&#x201d;<br><br>That more or less settled the college discussion. It&#x2019;s hard to beat one of the Seven Sisters. But Anne thought otherwise.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I went to Denison.&#x201d; Anne beamed at Harry. &#x201c;Not Ivy League but I am proud of my alma mater.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Back to Richmond.&#x201d; Lisa tapped the architecture books. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s estimated that four hundred thousand people will move to the city in the next ten years. Where are we going to put them so they won&#x2019;t destroy natural habitats?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about on riverboats?&#x201d; Harry remarked.<br><br>&#x201c;Why would anyone live on a boat?&#x201d; Pewter, tired of being in the store, grumbled.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe they like to fish.&#x201d; Tucker was practical.<br><br>&#x201c;Houseboats can be pretty,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy said. &#x201c;Remember that old movie Harry and Fair watched? Houseboat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hollywood.&#x201d; Pewter sniffed. &#x201c;Of course the boat looked good. They need to make more movies about cats.&#x201d;<br><br>Slyly, Tucker responded, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re planning that right now.&#x201d;<br><br>Pewter bared her fangs. Harry saw it just in time. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare. I&#x2019;ll never bring you in this store again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bother.&#x201d; But Pewter did close her mouth.<br><br>Anne put a bow on the large paper bag. &#x201c;Here. You can reuse it.&#x201d; She handed it to Lisa.<br><br>&#x201c;I can.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any presents for me,&#x201d; Pewter complained.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t read,&#x201d; the corgi fired at her.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t read. At least I can.&#x201d; The fat gray cat sniffed.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, patting at the pages of a book or the computer screen isn&#x2019;t reading,&#x201d; Tucker replied.<br><br>That fast, Pewter boxed the corgi&#x2019;s upright ears. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you insult me, you illiterate cur.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop it. We&#x2019;ll get thrown out of the store. I like it here,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy told them.<br><br>Both Harry and Lisa carried their treasures in large shopping bags. Harry followed Lisa and Raynell to the Nature First office down the hall from Over the Moon, as they were both located in a new commercial building.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Felipe,&#x201d; Lisa called to the number two man in the organization.<br><br>Looking up from his computer, he said, &#x201c;What a haul. You must have bought out the store. You, too, Raynell, but you showed a little more restraint. Oh, hello, Harry, and your posse, too.&#x201d; He smiled at the pets.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here!&#x201d; A nine-�week-�old Irish wolfhound puppy, already substantial, raced out from Lisa&#x2019;s office.<br><br>Pewter puffed up. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me!&#x201d;<br><br>The puppy stopped cold.<br><br>&#x201c;Just ignore her,&#x201d; Tucker counseled the youngster. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pirate. Lisa bought me and she is taking me to work but I have to be quiet and I have to ask to go to the bathroom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good idea,&#x201d; commented Mrs. Murphy, who knew how big the Irish wolfhound would grow to be.<br><br>Harry set her bag on a corner table, knelt down. &#x201c;Hello, puppy. Aren&#x2019;t you beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>Pirate ambled right over, placed his head in Harry&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;You are a nice person. And you&#x2019;re walking with Lisa, you have to be a nice person. I start school after Christmas. I have a new collar and leash.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lisa, he&#x2019;s beautiful. When did you decide to have a dog?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been thinking about it. I live alone. I like dogs but I was always on the go. Now that I&#x2019;m settled I thought this is the time. Well, come on, let me show you what Gary&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;<br><br>Raynell ducked into a small office near the front door.<br><br>The two walked through the changes Gary had made, which mostly involved moving or angling walls. Clever. His alterations brought in more light, taking full advantage of the many windows in the new building. Although an architect, he also guided Lisa and Felipe to interesting furniture, comfortable chairs in natural colors. Gorgeous photographs of Virginia&#x2019;s wonders covered the walls: the falls in Richmond, the Chesapeake Bay, the Blue Ridge Mountains, the bridges of Norfolk and Virginia Beach that ran over to the long spit of land, the Eastern Shore. The combination of bridges and tunnels traversing the bay were an engineering wonder. Then again, Virginia was home to one of the Eight Engineering Wonders of the World, the four tunnels that Claudius Crozet dug out of the Blue Ridge Mountains for the new form of transportation, railroads. He had no dynamite. It was all done by hand. Two of the tunnels remained in service. The other two were being reclaimed and rehabilitated as part of a walking tour. Another large photograph of a bald eagle soaring over the James River, sun glistening off his wings, had pride of place when you walked into Lisa&#x2019;s office.<br><br>&#x201c;This is wonderful,&#x201d; Harry exclaimed.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost done. Gary wants to come make sure the cabinets fit in. You simply touch the front of them and they open.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No kidding.&#x201d; Harry reached out, pressed the front and sure enough the cabinet opened noiselessly.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re enameled. That was expensive but it looks fabulous,&#x201d; Lisa enthused.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you like puppies?&#x201d; Pirate asked Mrs. Murphy.<br><br>&#x201c;I do as long as you don&#x2019;t slobber on me,&#x201d; the tiger answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Puppies are disgusting. They poop, they pee, they slobber, they throw up, they chew. Ugh!&#x201d; Pewter bared her fangs.<br><br>&#x201c;Ignore her,&#x201d; Tucker again told the puppy.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you live with her?&#x201d; Pirate wondered.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a choice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You would be bored without me. Bored to tears. You have no new thoughts. You rely on me.&#x201d; Pewter lifted a paw to lick it, languidly.<br><br>&#x201c;What about the other kitty?&#x201d; the large puppy inquired.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re friends.&#x201d; Tucker smiled as Mrs. Murphy came over to sit with the corgi while the humans babbled on.<br><br>Lisa was showing Harry her revitalized office. Sleek, the only knickknacks were little rubber dinosaurs and some detailed decoys.<br><br>The bookshelves, also enameled, reflected light. Behind a row of dinosaur and raptor books two long black legs poked out. Harry, ever curious, peeked behind the books, jumped back.<br><br>&#x201c;Lifelike! What&#x2019;s a rubber tarantula doing here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I actually had Mildred, I call her Mildred, on the shelf, but Raynell hates spiders, so I sort of hid her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hate spiders, too,&#x201d; Pewter pronounced.<br><br>Pirate asked, &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too many legs. If you walk into a web it takes time to clean it off. Those strands are sticky,&#x201d; Pewter said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; The big-�little puppy, wide-�eyed, looked at the fat cat, who was always happy to be the authority.<br><br>Harry, now back at the entrance door, knelt to again pet the puppy. &#x201c;Lisa, the best friends come on four feet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bye,&#x201d; Tucker and Mrs. Murphy said to the puppy while Pewter strolled out in front of everyone.<br><br>&#x201c;Come back. We can play!&#x201d; Pirate wagged his tail.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll try. Wish we could drive.&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;Merry Christmas, Lisa. Merry Christmas, Felipe and Raynell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You, too,&#x201d; they called back.<br><br>The four hurried to Harry&#x2019;s Volvo station wagon as it began to sleet, now turning to snow. The precipitation wasn&#x2019;t heavy but it was cold. Harry wanted to get home before the roads turned slick as an eel.<br><br>&#x201c;Turn on the heater,&#x201d; Pewter demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;She will. You have a fur coat. She doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Tucker reminded the fatty.<br><br>&#x201c;Humans lack fur, claws, sharp teeth. They are so slow. I mean they can&#x2019;t run. Hearing, pfft. But their eyes are good.&#x201d; Pewter added something positive.</p><h2>Rebel Dream: Enemy Lines I (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order #11)</h2><p><b><i>As the Yuuzhan Vong&#x2019;s spectacular conquests continue unchecked, Luke Skywalker, Han and Leia Solo , and Wedge Antilles are forced to destroy what they have risked their lives to create. . . .</i></b><br><br>Scattering like rats before the Yuuzhan Vong&#x2019;s invasion of Coruscant, the panic-stricken members of the New Republic Advisory&#x2019;s Council pause just long enough to set up a mock defense on nearby Borleias&#x2014;a transparent attempt to buy time that fools no one, least of all the Jedi.<br><br>Leia and Han Solo trek from world to world to foment rebellion against the New Republic&#x2019;s disastrous appeasement policies. But Luke Skywalker has chosen the most dangerous assignment of all: to sneak into the Yuuzhan Vong&#x2019;s stronghold on Coruscant. His outrageous scheme to gain entry is either brilliant or suicidal, depending on the outcome. And bearing down swiftly on Borleias is a Vong invasion fleet, determined to destroy the galaxy&#x2019;s remaining defenders. . . .</p><p><b>Aaron Allston</b> was the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of thirteen <i>Star Wars </i>novels as well as the Doc Sidhe novels, which combine 1930s-style hero-pulp fiction with Celtic myth. In addition to being a writer, he was a game designer, and in 2006 he was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design Hall of Fame. Allston died in 2014.One Month Ago, Pyria System: Borleias Occupation, Day 1<br><br>&#x201c;A god cannot die,&#x201d; Charat Kraal said. &#x201c;Therefore it can have no fear of death. So who is braver, a god or a mortal?&#x201d;<br><br>Charat Kraal was a pilot of the Yuuzhan Vong&#x2014;humanoid, a little over two meters in height. His skin, where it was not covered by geometric tattoos, was pale, marked everywhere by the white, slightly reflective lines of old scars. Some years-ago mishap had eaten away the center of his face, eliminating even the diminutive nose common to the Yuuzhan Vong, leaving behind brown-crusted cartilage and horizontal holes into his sinus passages. His forehead angled back less dramatically than many of the Yuuzhan Vong and looked a trifle more like the forehead of a human, for which two warriors had taunted him, for which he had killed them. He disguised the trait as much as he could by yanking out the last of the hair on his head and adding skulltop tattoos that drew the eye up and back, away from the offending forehead. One day he would earn an implant that would further mask his deformity and end his problem.<br><br>He wore an ooglith cloaker, the transparent environment suit of Yuuzhan Vong pilots, over a simple warrior&#x2019;s loincloth. Both garments were living creatures, engineered and bred to perform only the tasks demanded of them, to aid the Yuuzhan Vong in their pursuit of glory.<br><br>He sat in the cockpit of his coralskipper, the irregular rocklike space fighter of his kind, but he did not wear his cognition hood at the moment; the masklike creature that kept him in mental contact with his craft, that allowed him to sense with its senses and pilot it with the agility of thought rather than muscle and reaction, was set to the side while his coralskipper cruised on routine patrol.<br><br>He and his mission partner, Penzak Kraal, were in distant orbit above the world Borleias. The planet had been recently seized from the infidels native to this galaxy so that it could be used as a staging area for the Yuuzhan Vong assault on the galactic throneworld of Coru- scant. Borleias was an agreeably green world, not overgrown with the dead, crusty dwellings of the infidels, not strewn with their unnatural implements of technology; only a military base, now smashed, had affronted the Yuuzhan Vong with evidence of infidel occupation.<br><br>The voice of Penzak Kraal emerged from the small, head-shaped villip mounted on the cockpit wall just beneath the canopy. Though most coralskippers were not equipped with villips, relying instead on the telepathic signals of yammosk war coordinators for all their communications, long-distance patrol craft did call for a means for direct communications. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be an idiot. If a god is the god of bravery, then by definition he must be braver than any Yuuzhan Vong, than anything living.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder. Let us say then that you could become immortal as the gods, and never die, but remain one of the Yuuzhan Vong. You would never face death. Could you then be as brave as the Yuuzhan Vong? You could kill forever but never truly risk death, defy death, choose your time and place of death. Which is better, to be brave for a lifetime or to kill forever?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who cares? The choice is not ours. But if I were to choose, I think I would choose immortality. Live long enough, and you might learn how to be brave as a Yuu- zhan Vong again. Kill long enough, and you could perhaps learn to kill a star.&#x201d;<br><br>Charat Kraal sobered. &#x201c;I have heard . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That the infidels did that. Learned to kill a star.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard Penzak Kraal hiss in irritation; in the villip he saw his partner&#x2019;s lopsided features go even more off center as his mouth pulled down in an expression of contempt. &#x201c;So what if they did? They killed it the wrong way, with their wrong minds and their wrong devices. And, like idiots, they must have lost the secret. Or they&#x2019;d be destroying the worldships one by one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have also heard . . .&#x201d; Charat Kraal lowered his voice, a foolish instinct, since no one but Penzak Kraal could be listening to him. &#x201c;That gods may smile upon them, too. On the infidels.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ridiculous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can you know the minds of the gods?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can no more know the minds of the gods than summon one of the enemy battleships to destroy for my personal glory.&#x201d;<br><br>In the distance, away from Borleias, many kilometers from them, an enemy battleship winked into existence, its bow pointed toward them. The ship was already up to speed; it grew rapidly as it neared them, as it approached Borleias.<br><br>&#x201c;Penzak, you fool.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My words did not summon it, you idiot.&#x201d; The villip&#x2019;s face blurred and adjusted, reflecting a change to Pen- zak&#x2019;s features; Penzak had pulled on his cognition hood. Charat did likewise. His surroundings, the cockpit interior, seemed to become transparent, giving him a view in all directions through the senses of the coralskipper, showing him in breathtaking detail the onrushing enemy ship.<br><br>No, now it was ships. More and more of the loathsome things of metal were dropping out of hyperspace, all aimed at Borleias. At Charat and Penzak.<br><br>A moment later, Charat could feel a buzz through the cognition hood, a telltale sign that Penzak was sending a warning to the Domain Kraal commander on Borleias.<br><br>The foremost New Republic ship, a sharply angled triangle in white, passed over the two coralskippers, blotting out the sun, casting them into shadow. Nowhere near so large as a Yuuzhan Vong worldship, it was still of impressive size, and so near that Charat felt he could reach out and drag his finger along its hull as it passed.<br><br>Penzak Kraal sent his coralskipper into a dive and turned to match the larger craft&#x2019;s course. Charat paced him. Above, he saw thruster gouts from the ship&#x2019;s belly herald the launching of the hated infidel starfighers.<br><br>&#x201c;How do we hurt them worst?&#x201d; Charat asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Follow me in,&#x201d; Penzak said. &#x201c;While they&#x2019;re launching. Don&#x2019;t engage the fighters; bait them so they follow us. The ship won&#x2019;t fire on us with the fighters in close proximity. We&#x2019;ll enter their launching bays and destroy the facilities there, then gut the ship from within.&#x201d; He looped around, rising and angling in toward the ship&#x2019;s belly. Charat followed.<br><br>Mon Mothma, one of the newest cruisers in the New Republic&#x2019;s fleet, a Star Destroyer refitted with gravity-well generators capable of interfering with the short jumps made by Yuuzhan Vong craft, cruised straight toward Borleias from the point where it had dropped out of hyperspace. This hadn&#x2019;t been a timed drop&#x2014;they&#x2019;d plotted a course straight for the planet Borleias, and the planet&#x2019;s gravity well had dragged them into realspace when they&#x2019;d come close enough. And now before them was the blue-green world they had come to recapure.<br><br>&#x201c;No sign of a Yuuzhan Vong worldship in orbit,&#x201d; reported the sensor officer, a Mon Calamari male with deep blue skin. &#x201c;The two coralskippers are turning to engage.&#x201d;<br><br>General Wedge Antilles, a lean man with a careworn face and military posture, commander of the fleet group for which Mon Mothma was the flagship, nodded. &#x201c;Gunnery, stay on them, vape them if they come against us. Fighter control, continue launching starfighter squadrons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Data screens lit up with colored blips as New Republic starfighters&#x2014;X-wings, A-9s, B-wings, E-wings, and more&#x2014;streamed out of the docking bays and turned toward the planet. Wedge, standing at the captain&#x2019;s station toward the rear of the spacious bridge, ignored the screens. He concentrated instead on the live view of Borleias, which filled the main viewport at the bow end of the bridge.<br><br>I hope the Vong here have come to love this world, he told himself. Because I&#x2019;m going to take it from them. They&#x2019;re going to learn what it is to lose the things they love.<br><br>Luke Skywalker hit his thrusters. His X-wing roared out of the main docking bay, losing altitude relative to the Mon Mothma. Behind him, eleven pilots of Twin Suns Squadron, the temporary X-wing squad that was his command, formed up on him. &#x201c;Twin Suns away,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Twin Suns, copy.&#x201d; That would be the controller on Mon Mothma&#x2019;s bridge. &#x201c;Be advised, two coralskippers are maneuvering into your flight path.&#x201d;<br><br>Luke glanced at his sensor board. Two red blips were indeed turning from below to head toward them. &#x201c;Squadron, follow me out, let&#x2019;s give these two the gauntlet treatment.&#x201d;<br><br>He heard a chorus of acknowledgments. There was tension in some of the voices, but not alarm. All his pi- lots were veterans, survivors of the Sabers, the Shocks, and other squadrons that had been reduced to shield trios, wing pairs, and solo pilots during the Yuuzhan Vong attack on Coruscant mere days earlier. Two of them, forming with him a shield trio, were his wife, Mara Jade Skywalker, and the Corellian-Security-officer-turned-pilot-turned-Jedi named Corran Horn. All his pilots were disciplined and competent. Many wanted revenge.<br><br>Luke understood how they felt. The Vong, aided by their human agent Viqi Shesh, had almost managed to kidnap his and Mara&#x2019;s infant son, Ben, just days ago. They had killed his nephew Anakin, and his nephew Jacen was missing. The losses, especially that of his apprentice Anakin, created an ache within him that he could not soothe.<br><br>In his youth, Luke would have been anxious for payback, but today he set that portion of himself aside. That was dark side thinking, immature thinking. It had been a long time since he had been a smooth-faced innocent; the scars of combat and lines of age had accumulated on his face, matching the weight of experience and calm that had accumulated on his spirit.<br><br>He extended his perceptions and sought Mara with them. He found her and almost flinched away from the contact; she was now an icy presence, concentrated totally on their mission.<br><br>He shrugged. Iciness was better than one alternative. Mara, despite her cool and controlled manner, was as anguished as he by the near loss of Ben and the loss of their nephews, and it would be no surprise to find her lit like a lightsaber with a desire for revenge. The fact that she wasn&#x2019;t meant that she was in control.<br><br>&#x201c;S-foils to attack position,&#x201d; Luke said, and suited action to words by flipping the switch that split the X-wings&#x2019; flight surfaces into their familiar X-shaped attack profile. &#x201c;First and third trios, take the leader, the rest on the wingmate. Fire at will.&#x201d; He linked his lasers to quad fire, so that all four would fire with a single press of the trigger, and opened up on the lead coralskipper. Four red streams of destructive laser energy lanced out against the coralskipper&#x2014;<br><br>No, it was eight streams. Luke&#x2019;s burst, aimed at the starboard side of the skip, never reached its target; a blackness appeared before it, distorting space around it like a gigantic magnifying lens, drawing the laserfire into it. Those four red lances of energy simply bent and dis- appeared. But Mara&#x2019;s burst, aimed at the port side, hit the coralskipper an instant after Luke&#x2019;s vanished. He grinned; she must have been using her own Force abilities to monitor him, as well. She couldn&#x2019;t have timed it so expertly otherwise. Her lasers raked across the enemy starfighter&#x2019;s hull until the distortion flicked over to interpose itself, then Luke fired again, chipping away at the coralskipper&#x2019;s stern. His blasts were joined by Corran&#x2019;s. The coral-like material of the skip&#x2019;s hull superheated and the lasers tore red-hot gouges along the surface.</p><h2>The Quiet Music of Gently Falling Snow</h2><p>A beautifully illustrated collection of interconnected folk tales by internationally bestselling author Jackie Morris, set in a world of music, curious animals, and towers that reach the stars. The tales are illustrated with a series of musically-themed illustrations, originally created for UK charity Help Musicians.</p><p><b>Jackie Morris </b>is an internationally bestselling author, illustrator, and photographer. She is the author of <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</i>; <i>Can You See a Little Bear</i>; and <i>Tell Me a Dragon</i>.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Music, snow, and well-dressed fairies figure prominently in the dozen sumptuous paintings in this oversize volume of original tales. Morris painted the scenes, one each year, as elegant Christmas cards on commission as part of a fund-raiser for England's Help Musicians UK charity. Her wintry scenes, enlarged here and positioned above the text, are fairy-tale vignettes filled with fanciful figures and structures large and small. Fay musicians ride on bears, tigers, and other animals and sometimes travel in clever carriages or air vehicles. Morris describes the newly invented stories as "a series of lullabies for grown-ups," and it does seem unlikely that children would enter into them. They're dreamy and romantic, lyrical, and also elusive in recounting the arrival of unnamed folks by sea where "there had been no music heard in the land for centuries." It takes patient reading through poetic, often vague but also imaginative tales to grasp events, characters, and shifts of sequence in the tales of loss and love and quest to restore the music.

The result? The majority of spine operations are unnecessary and many surgeries are performed on spines with normal, age-related conditions.</p> <p>When performed for a specific anatomical problem with matching symptoms, the outcomes are consistently satisfying. Conversely, when surgery is conducted to address pain without a clear source, the consequences can be unpredictable, with a high percent of patients faring poorly or becoming much worse (catastrophic). A failed spinal surgery can virtually destroy one&#x2019;s life. Additionally, when a patient&#x2019;s nervous system is fired up from stress, results are often poor.</p> <p>A common cry from patients is, &#x201c;If I only knew how badly this could turn out, I would have never had this surgery.&#x201d; The depth of frustration at making the wrong decision is beyond words because there is no turning back.</p> <p>If you are facing a decision about spine surgery, <em>Do You Really Need Spine Surgery? </em>provides you and your medical providers important information to help make the best choice. <em>All</em> relevant variables are addressed and organized into a &#x201c;treatment grid.&#x201d; With this grid, you and your health care team can determine the most effective approach and course of action, with full consideration to the potential downside of a failed spinal surgery.</p> <p><em>Do You Really Need Spine Surgery? </em>gives back control of the surgical decision to you, the patient. Take it!!</p></p><p><p>David Hanscom, MD is a renowned spine surgeon of 30 years. His revolutionary approach to treating chronic pain has helped hundreds of patients live pain-free.&nbsp;His pioneering book, <em>Back in Control: A Surgeon&#x2019;s Roadmap Out of Chronic Pain</em>, showed chronic pain sufferers how to quiet a turbocharged central nervous system, relieve the anxiety and depression that often accompany chronic pain, and make a full recovery. In addition to being a best-selling author, he is a frequent guest on TV and radio programs, and is a sought after speaker at medical conferences around the world.</p></p><h2>Poetry for Young People: William Shakespeare (Volume 10)</h2><p><p>Classic verses about love and jealousy, friendship and betrayal, politics and ambition, and the complexity of human life.

This large-format volume from the Poetry for Young People series presents three sonnets as well as 24 excerpts from the plays of William Shakespeare. The sonnets are accessible as well as beautiful, but the use of dramatic excerpts is problematic. Some speeches, such as "All the world's a stage," from <i>As You Like It</i> and "The quality of mercy is not strained," from <i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> work well in this short anthology. Others, such as the two excerpts from <i>Henry IV, Part One</i>, seem unlikely to appeal as poetry, particularly to young people who do not know the play. Glenn Harrington has illustrated selections with impressionistic paintings. Often focusing on a single character, the paintings are well composed and richly colored. Consider this attractive book as supplementary material for children's collections with a demand for Shakespeare. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

During his lifetime and after his death, followers collected, for their own purposes, numerous stories, anecdotes, and reports about Francis. As a result, the man himself and his own concerns became lost in legend.</p><p>In this authoritative and engaging new biography, Augustine Thompson, O.P., sifts through the surviving evidence for the life of Francis using modern historical methods. The result is a complex yet sympathetic portrait of the man and the saint. Francis emerges from this account as very much a typical thirteenth-century Italian layman, but one who, when faced with unexpected crises in his personal life, made decisions so radical that they challenge his own society&#x2015;and ours. Unlike the saint of legend, this Francis never had a unique divine inspiration to provide him with rules for following the teachings of Jesus. Rather, he spent his life reacting to unexpected challenges, before which he often found himself unprepared and uncertain. The Francis who emerges here is both more complex and more conflicted than that of older biographies. His famed devotion to poverty is found to be more nuanced than expected, perhaps not even his principal spiritual concern. Thompson revisits events small and large in Francis's life, including his troubled relations with his father, his contacts with Clare of Assisi, his encounter with the Muslim sultan, and his receiving the Stigmata, to uncover the man behind the legends and popular images.</p><p>A tour de force of historical research and biographical writing, <i>Francis of Assisi: A New Biography</i> is divided into two complementary parts&#x2015;a stand alone biographical narrative and a close, annotated examination of the historical sources about Francis. Taken together, the narrative and the survey of the sources provide a much-needed fresh perspective on this iconic figure. "As I have worked on this biography," Thompson writes, "my respect for Francis and his vision has increased, and I hope that this book will speak to modern people, believers and unbelievers alike, and that the Francis I have come to know will have something to say to them today."</p></p><p>Augustine Thompson, O.P., is Professor of History at the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California. His most recent book is <i>Cities of God: The Religion of the Italian Communes, 1125&#x2013;1325</i>.<br><br><p>Augustine Thompson, O.P., is Professor of History at the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California. He is also the author of <em>Cities of God: The Religion of the Italian Communes, 1125&#x2013;1325.</em></p><p> "This is not a typical biography of Francis of Assisi (1181-1226). Thompson, a Dominican priest and church historian, bases his biography solidly on verifiable material. He seeks the historical Francis, not the Francis of legend, and succeeds admirably in this task. Anyone interested in Francis will like the first part: a well-written, straightforward biography. In the second part, which will appeal to scholars and more serious readers, Thompson discusses in some detail the sources for Francis's life, weighing one against another, and makes some judgments on the work of previous biographers. He also tries to distinguish practices instituted by Francis himself from those instituted later. A well-written, scholarly portrait of a saint whose biography has been based too often on legends. This one is accessible to the lay reader and a treasure for historians."--<em>Library Journal </em>(starred review)</p><br><br><p> "Among Thompson's many keen yet painful insights into the historical Francis, one stands out and serves to bind together the entire narrative and to shed light on the discordant history of the Franciscan order: Leadership was an 'intolerable burden' to Francis, spiritually, 'one he wished to be rid of as quickly as possible.' . . . The stripped-down, bare-bones historical Francis of this biography is at once immensely likeable and deeply disturbing. He is appealing insofar as Thompson makes him seem much more like an ordinary man who accomplished extraordinary things rather than a heaven-sent, self-assured prophet. His befuddlement, his inner turmoil, his inability to control events make him seem not just very human but also much like nearly anyone who is likely to pick up this book."--Carlos Eire, <em>First Things </em>(Spring 2012)</p><br><br><p> "Francis of Assisi so impressed the people of his own time that even before his death a rich field of stories, images, anecdotes, and reports of miracles had sprung up. These so enveloped the saint that many scholars have despaired of uncovering the man behind the legends. But this new, lucid study by Thompson largely achieves this goal. A distinctive feature of the project is its division into two complementary parts. Part 1 is an engaging, well-written new biography of the saint. Part 2 is a closely annotated examination of the sources and debates about Francis. The advantage of this division is that the biography stands alone, unencumbered by scholarly apparatus, yet in the second part the author displays the reasoning that leads him to believe that he gives a truer picture of the man Francis than other biographers do."--<em>Choice</em> (October 2012)</p><br><br><p> "I recommend this book strongly to anyone serious about understanding Francis of Assisi. I admire the clarity and brevity of the writing. With decisiveness, Thompson cuts through the conflicting medieval accounts of each event in Francis' life, adjusts for the hagiographers' spin and creates a credible chronology out of the blurry dates. His knowledge of medieval Italy allows him to provide insightful explanations of the legal, liturgical, and ecclesiastical practices of the time."--Paul Moses, <em>America</em></p><br><br><p> "The Francis that Thompson portrays is both more complex and more conflicted than older biographies. His famed devotion to poverty was actually more nuanced, and perhaps not even his principal spiritual concern, says Thompson. . . . This new biography may be a more realistic picture of the life of this noteworthy forerunner and well-known spiritual aspirant."--<em>The Beacon</em> (January-March 2013)</p><br><br><p> "This new biography is the work of an accomplished medieval scholar and a Dominican friar, Augustine Thompson OP, who brings to his examination of the Franciscan sources a welcome freshness and objectivity which lead him to question some of the hagiographical assumptions about <em>il poverello d'Assisi </em>and the movement which he inspired."--Michael Robson, <em>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</em> (July 2013)</p><br><br><p> "Thompson's biography of Francis is history-writing at its modern best. It challenges and rewards the non-expert reader who is willing to leave aside holy cards and legends to glimpse one of Christianity's most familiar yet least well-known saints, the beloved, impulsive, contradictory, strange yet attractive Francis of thirteenth-century Italy."--Andrew Thornton, <em>American Book Review</em> (March 2013)</p><br><br><p> "The book's division into two sections, the biography proper followed by the critical apparatus, gives Thompson greater freedom to engage both the primary sources and the tangle of modern Franciscan scholarship more vigorously. Such an arrangement also renders the book eminently accessible to the general reader while maintaining its status as a substantial contribution to a variety of academic disciplines, including Medieval history, cultural studies, Christian spirituality, and Italian literature. . . . By contextualizing and grounding Francis in his precise historical and cultural milieu, Thompson gives us a Francis who is more human, more alive, and more relevant to our own times--and no less a saint."--Scott Surrency, <em>Canadian Journal of History</em> (Spring/Summer 2013)</p><br><br><p> "As one of the best-loved figures in the Christian tradition, Francis of Assisi has been the subjet of innumberable studies and biographies. Is another one necessary? Is there anything further to say? Are new interpretations possible? This biography, by the American Dominican medievalist Augustine Thompson, answers these questions with a resounding 'yes', and the result is a genuinely ground-breaking <em>tour de force</em> that should become the standard English language introduction to Francis and his times."--Colman O Clabaigh, OSB, <em>Religious Life Review</em> (September/October 2013)</p><br><br><p> "This is an excellent book for lay readers and professional historians alike with two distinct, albeit related, works between its covers: an elegant and highly accessible biography of St. Francis of Assisi, followed by a learned and in-depth analysis of the most important scholarship on Francis from the late nineteenth century to the present. . . . Thompson's talents as a historian are evident throughout his work. . . . This is not merely a new but also an outstanding biography of St. Francis that deserves a wide readership from scholars immersed in the study of this legendary saint and also from the many individuals today (Christian and non-Christian alike) who continue to find deep meaning in the life and deeds of this medieval holy man from Assisi"--Bernard Schlager, <em>The Historian </em>(April 2014)</p></p><h2>Jerusalem</h2><p>An instant modern classic&#x201d; <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br><br> One of the most exciting new plays in ages&#x201d; <i>New York Times</i><br><br> Jez Butterowrth&#x2019;s gorgeous, expansive new play keeps coming at its audience in unpredictable gusts, rolling from comic to furious, from winsome to bawdy&#x201d; <i>Observer</i><br><br><b>A Comic, contemporary vision of rural life in England&#x2019;s green and pleasant land.</b><br><br>On the morning of the local county fair, Johnny Byron is a wanted man.

After many incarnations of this pattern, their innate desire for growth and self-discovery became dormant.<br><br>Although this co-dependent pattern may have worked for them in the past, in order to help these natives heal this unresolved pattern of co-dependency in this lifetime, the flow of reciprocity in relationships isn't working in the way they expect. This is the Universe's way of telling them that they need to grow stronger as an individual, and reclaim their own independent identity. Only then can their relationships become truly satisfying.<br><br>Due to so many lifetimes of conditioning, these people still tend to believe that their personal happiness is dependent on keeping the other people in their relationships harmonious and happy. But this old pattern cannot produce the results they want; in the end they don't feel loved or happy. In fact, until they become conscious of this co-dependency, they don't know how to partner with self and do things on their own that support their individual happiness and personal growth.<br><br>Until they gain awareness, Aries North Node people may act out co-dependent tendencies in many ways. Because internally they feel like they can't make it on their own, they're always on the lookout for others to partner with, and they tend to try and jump into co-dependency dynamics very quickly. Also, they often behave in ways that lead the other person to think they aren't competent enough to function without them. They may say things like: "I really can't do this, will you do it?"<br><br>Instead of taking responsibility for their shortcomings and doing something to correct them, the native expects others to compensate for them. They tend to try to set things up so that anything they don't want to take responsibility for is their partner's responsibility. This blocks intimacy because eventually the other person starts to feel resentful. The truth is that the native CAN be completely functional and responsible, but subconsciously they want their partner to do certain things for them&#x2014;and vice versa&#x2014;in order to create the co-dependency.<br><br>In a healthy, mutually interdependent relationship, the partners also take on certain responsibilities for each other, and may even make up for some of each other's deficiencies. The important difference is that both people consciously agree to the arrangement as two separate individuals. For instance, if one partner enjoys cooking but hates shopping, and the other enjoys the experience of shopping but isn't a very good cook, they may agree to divide these tasks accordingly.<br><br>Instead, Aries North Node natives try to totally enmesh themselves in the other person's world: They revolve around their partner's concerns and want to do everything with them. Then they usually attempt to coerce their partner into also revolving around their concerns and sharing in their activities&#x2014;shopping, visiting parents, running errands, etc. They are trying to establish reciprocity by giving too much and then pulling on the other person to give back. But this is not true giving&#x2014;it's more like an insurance policy to guarantee that they will always be included as part of the team.<br><br>On an unconscious level, Aries North Node people think that this is the correct path to establish fulfilling relationships, but co-dependency ends up having the opposite effect. If they're not really "standing in their own space," they can't receive the love and appreciation that their partner gives to them. As a result, they don't feel like they truly belong. They give, and they're part of their partner's world, but when the other person doesn't do what the native wants, they may feel hurt and resentful because the other person isn't reciprocating in the way the native expected. And it blocks intimacy for their partner, because when they feel the native's resentment, they tend to pull back in order to protect themselves.<br><br>Aries North Node folks have no sense of self&#x2014;they want to be part of the other person's identity instead of discovering their own. Their energy is so invested in their relationship with the primary people in their life that sometimes&#x2014;in order to keep the energetic connection going&#x2014;they can become very controlling. They feel that as long as they have the other person "captured" in a relationship&#x2014;whether it's good or bad&#x2014;they have a sense of identity.<br><br>This control issue can extend to thinking they know what's best for their mates, their parents, their children&#x2014;everyone! They think people should do what they tell them because&#x2014;in their mind&#x2014;they so clearly have the other person's best interest at heart. However, because they are so enmeshed in the identity of others, they unknowingly get confused between what would make others feel more harmonious and what would make them feel more harmonious. They are also concerned that the behavior of those who are close can reflect badly on them, and feel responsible for their actions. So if their child (even as an adult) exhibits a misbehavior, they are afraid that others look down on them as the parent.<br><br>This co-dependency can be very draining for the other person. Those who are close often feel there's no breathing room with these natives. Although they may like feeling needed and wanted, they resent having to constantly push the native away just to get some space. And the native feels like everyone is pushing them away all the time and they don't understand why.<br><br>This dynamic blocks intimacy for both people: When the native tries harder to please the other person and enhance the co-dependency, it makes their partner feel like they need to create more distance. If the other person tries to take some quiet time alone to recharge, the native may take it personally and act like their partner is trying to avoid them. They tend to feel threatened by their partner's independent growth and development. But the best partnerships are created when the partners can share what each has learned individually. Then as each person grows as an individual, the more they have to offer the partnership.<br><br>However, until these natives become conscious, they can be so needy that it feels like an abyss to the other person. And without their partner's constant energy the native may feel lost and invisible. But the truth is that they will never feel really "seen" until they learn to see themselves. And the way they can begin to do this is by spending time alone, outside of the relationship.<br><br>So when their partner starts distancing themselves&#x2014;a signal that they need more space&#x2014;the relationship and the native will benefit from giving them that gift. In fact, time spent with themselves is the only way these people can start to discover themselves and reconnect with the fountain of independent energy within.<br><i><br>Creating Internal Harmony vs. Keeping Others Harmonious</i><br><br>Aries North Node people tend to be sweet and selfless and usually feel that it is part of their purpose&#x2014;and their responsibility&#x2014;to support the "team" and create harmony in their relationships. As a result, they focus on making everyone else happy&#x2014;their family, friends, employees, etc. But what tends to happen is that over time, others can come to expect the native to be responsible for their harmony, even at the native's own expense.<br><br>These natives are practicing selfless behavior in the extreme, which can encourage unrealistic expectations and lack of reciprocity in their partners. In fact, they often attract narcissistic partners. Because of their co-dependent tendencies, if the native thinks that the other person wants them to do something, they may do whatever it takes, even if that means sacrificing what they need to do for themselves.<br><br>However, eventually the native looks around and realizes that there's no reciprocity and they aren't getting their needs met. Then they feel sad and angry because they think they're being used. Even though they give others the impression "All I need to be happy is for you to be happy," it really doesn't work if the other person doesn't give back to them.<br><br>Aries North Node people can only resolve this issue when they are willing to recognize that it's NOT their job to make everyone else happy. Relating in a healthy way as an equal would mean saying: "If you're not happy, I'm sorry." Then they could do others the honor of acknowledging them as a separate person and allowing them to be responsible for their own happiness. The native also honors themselves when they do what they need to do in order to be personally happy.<br><br>These folks are learning that when their harmony is disrupted due to the way someone is treating them, then their approach to that person needs to change. It may be that they need to raise their voice or otherwise firmly let the other person know what they expect in the situation. They are finding out how to support others in being responsible for learning their own lessons. Whatever the other person is experiencing is a direct result of the energy they are putting out, and only by having to deal with the effects themself can their partner grow and change.<br><br>The native is also responsible for their own process of self-discovery, and part of that is noticing what does and does not work in the way they approach their relationships. For example, one client with this nodal position had a small business. Wanting to create harmony in the workplace, he was very supportive of his employees&#x2014;praising them for their work, handling situations where he felt they were upset, and going out of his way to be fair with them.<br><br>Over time, their egos began to surge and they became disrespectful. He finally realized that it was his business, and he was paying them to SUPPORT HIM, not the other way around. Once he became willing to accept responsibility for his own harmony, he told them what he needed to happen in the workplace. He let them know that he wanted a positive atmosphere, with no gossiping or negativity, and he wanted the customers treated with respect. Those employees who were willing to support his goals remained, and those who wouldn't or couldn't were replaced. The result was that his business began to thrive, and my client again felt harmonious.<br><br>Aries North Node people tend to value harmony above all. Consequently, they try to prevent those who are close from experiencing disharmony. They are learning that not everyone has harmony as their primary value. For instance, the other person may value internal conflict as a stepping-stone to gaining new insights and finding a higher resolution.<br><br>Generally, if the other person is upset for any reason, the native feels resentful. After all, they went out of their way to help the other person feel harmonious and their partner isn't cooperating! This dynamic blocks intimacy. Their partner feels violated because they don't have the space to be upset, and the native feels violated because they ignored their own inner harmony in order to help their partner feel harmonious&#x2014;and now they're upset anyway!<br><br>Since these people think the other person has to be harmonious in order for them to be harmonious, they often conceal the truth about how they feel, not saying anything that would hurt their partner's feelings. However, this blocks intimacy because the other person can't trust them to tell the truth about how they feel and what they really want in the relationship. Because of this insecurity, their partner may begin to withdraw. The other person would much prefer that the native be honest so they could work problems out together&#x2014;as equals. This would build true harmony in their relationships and allow the possibility for intimacy to be created.<br><br>However, until these natives build a stronger personal identity and start taking responsibility for maintaining their own inner harmony, they usually stay constantly tuned in to the other person, monitoring their moods. This makes it difficult for their partner to simply experience themselves without the native being in their space. Sometimes the other person just wants to be left alone rather than being "changed" in order to meet the native's needs for harmony.<br><br>The unconscious, underlying issue is that Aries North Node people often live vicariously through their significant others. If their partner is upset, even if it has nothing to do with them, they take it personally. If their partner starts to cry, they cry&#x2014;there are no boundaries. The other person ends up feeling that it's not okay to be upset because it's so upsetting to the native.<br><br>One reason people want to partner with another is so they can share their individual feelings, thoughts, and experiences and help each other grow. For example, the exchange could be as simple as the native just telling the other person: "When you yell and scream like that, it's upsetting to me"&#x2014;rather than trying to appease them. By giving them an honest reflection of how their expression is <br>affecting the native, they can help their partner to gain greater self-awareness.<br><br>However, in order for this to occur the native must let others be themselves and take responsibility for their own moods. The idea is for them to spend time alone to discover what they're feeling as a separate individual. Then something new will happen. Maybe they'll notice that what they felt when they thought their partner wasn't harmonious was that they felt out of harmony themselves.<br><br>Once the native becomes aware of their own internal state, they can experiment with honestly <br>sharing their feelings with their partner. For instance: "I'm feeling confused today&#x2014;how are you feeling?" If their partner is also experiencing confusion, it may just be a current mood in the atmosphere. And by each sharing their own individual experience, both of them can end up feeling better.</p><h2>The American Revolution: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Here is a brisk, accessible, and vivid introduction to arguably the most important event in the history of the United States--the American Revolution. <br><br>Between 1760 and 1800, the American people cast off British rule to create a new nation and a radically new form of government based on the idea that people have the right to govern themselves. In this lively account, Robert Allison provides a cohesive synthesis of the military, diplomatic, political, social, and intellectual aspects of the Revolution, paying special attention to the Revolution's causes and consequences. The book recreates the tumultuous events of the 1760s and 1770s that led to revolution, such as the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party, as well as the role the Sons of Liberty played in turning resistance into full-scale revolt. Allison explains how and why Americans changed their ideas of government and society so profoundly in these years and how the War for Independence was fought and won. He highlights the major battles and commanders on both sides--with a particular focus on George Washington and the extraordinary strategies he developed to defeat Britain's superior forces--as well as the impact of French military support on the American cause. In the final chapter, Allison explores the aftermath of the American Revolution: how the newly independent states created governments based on the principles for which they had fought, and how those principles challenged their own institutions, such as slavery, in the new republic. He considers as well the Revolution's legacy, the many ways its essential ideals influenced other struggles against oppressive power or colonial systems in France, Latin America, and Asia. <br><br>Sharply written and highly readable, <em>The American Revolution: A Very Short Introduction</em> offers a concise introduction to this seminal event in American history.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

This gripping story&nbsp;reveals the facts behind&nbsp;of the woman who unwittingly spread deadly bacteria, the epidemiologist who discovered her trail of infection, and the health department that decided her fate.&nbsp;Young readers will be on the edges of the seats wondering what happened to Mary and the innocent typhoid victims. With glossary, timeline, list of well-known typhoid sufferers and victims, further resource section, author's note, and source notes.</p></p><p>Gail Jarrow&#39;s nonfiction books have received numerous awards and distinctions, including a Robert F. Sibert Informational Honor, YALSA Award Nomination, Orbis Pictus Recommended Book, National Science Teachers Association Recommended Book, Kirkus Reviews Best Book, and a VOYA Honor Book. She lives in Ithaca, New York.Gr 5 Up&#x2014;Just who was Typhoid Mary? In this second installment of a planned trilogy featuring deadly diseases, the first being Red Madness: How a Medical Mystery Changed What We Eat (Calkins Creek, 2014), Jarrow relates the account of Typhoid Mary, also known as Mary Mallon, and places it in historical context, explaining the devastating effects of typhoid fever. A symptomless carrier of typhoid, Mallon was a cook who inadvertently infected numerous people and was responsible for many deaths. Jarrow skillfully weaves Mallon's story into that of two other key figures working to fight and contain the disease: George Albert Soper, a sanitation engineer and typhoid expert; and Sara Josephine Baker, a doctor working at the New York City Department of Health. Citing newspaper articles, courtroom documents, and the personal accounts of several doctors, Jarrow acts as a medical detective, following the lives of Mallon, Soper, and Baker while illuminating a fascinating chapter in public health history. The work of Soper and Baker led to a dramatic decrease in typhoid cases as well as other infectious diseases. Mary, sadly, believed that she neither carried typhoid germs nor that she was responsible for outbreaks and spent most of her life virtually imprisoned on North Brother Island in New York's East River. A nonfiction page-turner relying upon extensive research and copious source notes, this is a fantastic addition to any library.&#x2014;Ragan O'Malley, Saint Ann's School, Brooklyn, NY</p><h2>Hedgie Blasts Off!</h2><p>More than anything Hedgie wants to be an astronaut and travel into space. He gets his chance the day the geyser, Big Sparkler, starts to sputter and fade, disappointing all the alien tourists, who fly to the tiny planet of Mikkop to throw coins into Big Sparkler and look at the strange flowers that survive on its sparkles.<p>Because only Hedgie can fit into a small space ship, he flies to Mikkop, where he not only finds out what is clogging up Big Sparkler, but fixes the problem in a most unusual way. He returns home a hero amid cheers from the aliens and the scientists back at the Star Lab.</p><p>With an amazing gatefold illustration of Hedgie bursting out of Big Sparkler this is not only one of Jan Brett's most inventive books, but it's one of the funniest.

Hedgie the hedgehog loves heading the cleanup crew at Star Lab, but he longs to be an astronaut. The lab's scientists are concerned about Big Sparkler, an outer-space, volcano-like formation that has stopped emitting sparks that cause beautiful gardens to grow on its planet. When the lab's robot is damaged, Hedgie, who fits neatly into the lab's pint-size rocket, undertakes a mission to investigate. Ingenious Hedgie successfully restores Big Sparkler, which was damaged by space tourists. The setup is a bit clumsy, but, as usual, Brett's exquisite artwork will easily draw children's interest, particularly in scenes of underdog, child-size Hedgie soaring triumphantly through the beautifully imagined depths of outer space. One nagging question about the animal character groupings: Why are all the dogs scientists; the journalists birds; and Hedgie, the only hedgehog, an astronaut? Teachers may want to use this as a starting point for discussions of how humans impact the environment.

Within a year, Gia was one of the top models of the late 1970's, gracing the covers of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> and <i>Vogue,</i> partying at New York's Studio 54 and the Mudd Club, and redefining the industry's standard of beauty. She was the darling of moguls and movie stars, royalty and rockers. Gia was also a girl in pain, desperate for her mother's approval&#x2014;and a drug addict on a tragic slide toward oblivion, who started going directly from $10,000-a-day fashion shoots to the heroin shooting galleries on New York's Lower East Side. Finally blackballed from modeling, Gia entered a vastly different world on the streets of New york and Atlantic City, and later in a rehab clinic. At twenty-six, she became on of the first women in America to die of AIDS, a hospital welfare case visited only by rehab friends and what remained of her family. <br>Drawing on hundreds of interviews with Gia's gamily, lovers, friends, and colleagues, <i>Thing of Beauty</i> creates a poignant portrait of an unforgettable character&#x2014;and a powerful narrative about beauty and sexuality, fame and objectification, mothers and daughters, love and death.</p><p>Trashy celebrity bios are usually diminished by the fact that we&#39;ve already heard the stories about Lonnie and Burt, or Madonna and Sean, or whoever the current target is. Author Stephen Fried manages to get all the sleaze value plus a lot of surprises by choosing supermodel Gia Carangi as his topic. Although her face is widely recognized, Gia finished her modeling career in a blaze of heroin and disease just before the time when models became celebrities with name recognition. Her life is the perfect fodder for the exploitation market, but Fried goes beyond that with fluid prose and a reporter&#39;s nose for tracking down sources. His stories about her teenage years, with their mix of late nights in Philadelphia&#39;s gay clubs, manic worship, and glam-style imitation of David Bowie, as well as tales of Gia&#39;s ability to seduce her friends, male and female, are the product of a lot of work and make for very interesting reading. Gia&#39;s unabashed homosexuality and early death from AIDS make her story a palimpsest of life on the edge in the America of the 1980s.Stephen Fried is an award-winning investigative journalist. His work has also appeared in <i>Vanity Fair, GQ,</i> and the <i>Washington Post Magazine.</i> A winner of a 1993 National Magazine Award, the Distinguished Service Award for Magazine Reporting from the Society of Professional Journalists, and the Clarion Award from Women in Communications, he lives in Philadelphia with his wife Diane Ayres, a fiction writer.</p><h2>Perdurabo, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Life of Aleister Crowley</h2><p>The name &#x201c;Aleister Crowley&#x201d; instantly conjures visions of diabolic ceremonies and orgiastic indulgences&#x2014;and while the sardonic Crowley would perhaps be the last to challenge such a view, he was also much more than &#x201c;the Beast,&#x201d; as this authoritative biography shows. <i>Perdurabo</i> (the magical name Crowley chose when inducted into the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) traces Crowley&#x2019;s remarkable journey from his birth as the only son of a wealthy lay preacher to his death in a boarding house as the world&#x2019;s foremost authority on magick. Along the way, he rebels against his conservative religious upbringing; befriends famous artists, writers, and philosophers (and becomes a poet himself ); is attacked for his practice of &#x201c;the black arts&#x201d;; and teaches that science and magick can work together. While seeking to spread his infamous philosophy of &#x201c;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,&#x201d; Crowley becomes one of the most notorious figures of his day. Based on Richard Kaczynski&#x2019;s twenty years of research, and including previously unpublished biographical details, <i>Perdurabo</i> paints a memorable portrait of the man who inspired the counterculture and influenced generations of artists, punks, wiccans, and other denizens of the demimonde.</p><p>Richard Kaczynski, Ph.D., is the author of <i>The Weiser Concise Guide to Aleister Crowley</i>, editor/annotator of a forthcoming edition of Crowley&#x2019;s <i>Sword of Song</i>, and co-editor with Hymenaeus Beta of <i>The Revival of Magick and Other Essays</i>. He has been a student of the Western hermetic tradition since 1978, and has lectured internationally on these topics since 1990. His writing has appeared in numerous magazines (<i>High Times, The Magical Link, Neshamah, Cheth, Mezlim, Eidolon, Different Worlds</i>) and books (<i>Concordance to the Holy Books of Thelema, The Golden Dawn Sourcebook, Rebels and Devils, People of the Earth</i>).&nbsp; A research scientist and statistician with the VA Northeast Program Evaluation Center, Kaczynski is also affiliated with Yale University&#x2019;s School of Medicine (Department of Psychiatry). He lives in Ellicott City, MD.&#x201c;From a historical perspective, 'Perdurabo' is the finest work on Crowley to date."<br> &#x2013;Peter J. Morris, writer and blogger<br><br>&#x201c;Although there have been several authoritative (and relatively impartial) bios of the occultist Aleister Crowley published in the last decade, in my opinion there is one that is definitely a cut above the rest. This would be <i>Perdurabo</i> by Richard Kaczynski, PhD. As "The definitive biography of the founder of modern magick," Kaczynski's revised and expanded edition of his 2002 offering is tirelessly researched (20 years!), highly detailed and loaded with photos, many of which are quite rare.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013;Toolband.com, official website of rock band TOOL<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Richard Kaczynski&#x2019;s <i>Perdurabo: the Life of Aleister Crowley</i> is the one biography that is absolutely necessary for anyone who wishes to know more about one of the most creative, seminal, and misunderstood figures of the last hundred years.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013;David Tibet, founder of Current 93<br> &nbsp;<br> "A brilliant essayist, a superior poet, and an extraordinary artist, mountaineer, and explorer, the Crowley presented in these witty and erudite pages is at once shocking, wise, egocentric, petty, inspirational and, most importantly, real. Roundly rejecting the pantomime villain at the center of previous biographies and deeply suspicious of the nonsensical hero-worship of some of his modern followers, Kaczynski's portrait of Crowley is balanced and well-informed. Rare illustrations support a superbly written and meticulously researched text.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013;Paul Feazey, LAShTAL.com<br><br>"<i>Perdurabo</i> is a magnificent biography not only on the colorful and fascinating figure himself, but on the occult, eastern religions, sexuality, and the attempt to apply the rigors of the scientific method to the so-called occult. Kaczynski does justice to Crowley&#x2019;s life and thought, solidly placing him with other great spiritual development figures. Anybody who wants to learn about Crowley would enjoy this book, while more serious followers will appreciate the previously unpublished biographical details and photographs."<br>&#x2013;<i>Sacramento Book Review</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is not only the most carefully-researched, detailed, and informative biography of Crowley yet written but also a remarkable insight into the nature of magic itself.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013;Ronald Hutton, author of <i>The Triumph of the Moon</i> and <i>Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Several recently-published biographies of Crowley do justice, for the most part, to his life and works. But their offerings now stand like skeletal frames of unfinished houses next to Kaczynski&#x2019;s magnificently constructed edifice. Every brick is set in place with the mortar of meticulous research and insight. Thank you, Dr. Kaczynski. I&#x2019;ve waited thirty-five years for this.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013;Lon Milo DuQuette, author of <i>The Magick of Aleister Crowley</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At long last, the world has a balanced and readable biography that reflects how magick shaped every facet of Aleister Crowley&#x2019;s life. And Dr. Kaczynski doesn&#x2019;t dismiss magick as humbug or mumbo-jumbo but validates it as a legitimate method of spiritual development meriting serious study.&#x201d;<br> &#x2013;Christopher S. Hyatt, PhD, author of <i>Undoing Yourself</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Richard Kaczynski uses a novelist&#x2019;s touch to make this exceptionally well-researched book read like an adventure story. For the serious student of Ceremonial magick or anyone curious about the truth behind all those weird stories, it&#x2019;s essential reading.... <i>Perdurabo</i> is bound to become the definitive biography on Aleister Crowley.&#x201d;<br> <i>&#x2013;NewWitch</i> magazine<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Aleister Crowley&#x2013;what a man. I've read several Crowley biographies, and this one takes the prize for most enjoyable and intimate. Mr. Kaczynski has the personal understanding and experience necessary to paint an accurate portrait of Crowley, with all the exciting context in place. Mr. Kaczynski's passion for his subject makes for an informative and potentially life-changing read. Why wade on the shores of such a vast man, when you can dive in?

But much of today&#x2019;s apologetics (engagement with the questions that people are asking about Christianity) come from suburban churches and academic studies. Urban believers&#x2014;those who live and minister in America&#x2019;s inner cities&#x2014;often face unique issues, not often addressed by the larger Christian community. These questions aren&#x2019;t neat or easy to answer but need to be addressed by applying biblical truth in the culture and challenges of urban life.</p><p>Author Chris Brooks has ministered for years in the urban environment as well as received extensive theological training. In Urban Apologetics, he seeks to connect the riches of the Christian apologetic tradition with the issues facing cities&#x2014;such as poverty, violence, and broken families. He brings an urban rhythm and sensitivity to the task of demonstrating the relevance of faith and the healing truth that Christ provides.</p></p><p>Christopher W.

She teaches writing and lives in Woodstock."What Comes Next and How to Like It is a beautifully felt, deeply moving memoir, the best work yet by a woman who has already done some of the best work in the field. It's about friendship, and the shocks friendship can endure when it's true and deep. It's about the rueful pleasures (not to mention the jarring pitfalls) of getting old. It's about enduring tragedy, sickness, and loss. Thomas speaks of these big things by scattering the ordinary jewelry of everyday life: loving dogs (even when they chew your most precious possessions), Googling old boyfriends, rescuing an orphan mouse, and trees that try to grow in the crack between boards. Small speaks for large here, in a calm voice that talks to the mind while it fills the heart. Abigail Thomas is the Emily Dickinson of memoirists, and so much of this book's wisdom is between the lines and in the white spaces. It may only take you two days to read, but the impact will stay with you for a long, long time. Abigail Thomas fills memory with living breath."

In this new book, Sarah Mally challenges girls to identify lies which are root issues behind struggles they face. Including thought-provoking cartoons, stories, biblical teaching, and practical steps of action, this book teaches girls to replace lies with the truth and align their thinking with God&#39;s Word. When a young lady learns to speak truth TO herself, she is planting her feet upon an unshakable foundation that will resist even the most powerful attacks of the enemy. She will see how God&#39;s Word will transform each area of her life as the truth sets her free!</p><p>Sarah is the founder of Bright Lights, a discipleship ministry designed to equip young ladies to use the years of their youth fully for Christ. This ministry started as a small girls' Bible study in her living room in 1996. Since that time Bright Lights has seen God's hand of direction and blessing in many ways. As of 2018, about 750 Bright Lights groups have started in 47 states and 18 countries. Bright Lights hosts conferences for mothers and daughters, trains and equips leaders of Bright Lights groups, and provides discipleship material for young ladies. Sarah is the author of <i>Before You Meet Prince Charming</i>, and the coauthor (with her siblings) of <i>Making Brothers and Sisters Best Friends</i>. The Mally family runs a ministry called Tomorrow's Forefathers, with the goal of equipping families to be strong in the Lord. They speak at conferences, churches, and camps, and organize discipleship and evangelism events for their church and community. They live in Marion, Iowa, and attend Cedar Rapids Bible Chapel."Years ago, as a young adult facing a lifetime of quadriplegia, I fell prey to many cultural lies I almost convinced myself that I'd be 'better off dead than disabled,' a lie promoted in dark corners of our society. Thankfully, the Word of God rescued me, especially as I opened my ears to its truth, and began reciting - even memorizing - its life-changing insights. Speaking God's truth to myself made all the difference between life and death. This is why I give a double thumbs-up to Sarah Mally's new book, <i>Speak Truth in Your Heart</i>. Powerful and practical, it will explain not only the value of biblical truth, but how to weave God's truth into every fiber of your being." --Joni Eareckson Tada, Joni and Friends International Disability Center<br><br>"<i>Speak Truth in Your Heart</i> is exactly what today's young ladies need to hear. Our youth hear so many lies from the world, from Satan, and from themselves. Sarah focuses on the importance of Bible memorization to squelch the lies with truths from God's Word. The book is saturated in the Gospel. Not only defining what it is but how young ladies can practically live out the Gospel in their lives. In addition, engaging personal stories and testimonies keep the reader's interest with just the right amount of journaling activities. I look forward to having my own teenage daughter read it!" --Georgia Purdom, PhD, Answers in Genesis<br><br>"We love this book and we love Sarah's passion for investing into young women! <i>Speak Truth in Your Heart</i> digs deep into God's Word and shows us, as modern young women, how to put off the lies and walk in true freedom.

It also teaches that since the fall it has always been unlawful to use the law of God in hopes of establishing one&#39;s own personal merit and justification. Commitment to obedience is but the lifestyle of faith, a token of gratitude for God&#39;s redeeming grace. Jesus said, &#34;if you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#34; (John 14:15). Moreover, we will strive to teach others to observe whatever He has commanded us (Matt. 28:18-20). Such healthy and necessary moral standards are surely not burdensome to the believer who bows to Christ as the Lord (1 John 5:3). Dr. Greg Bahnsen left this world for His eternal reward in Christ on December 11, 1995. We that remain are grateful to him for his labor, scholarship, love, and most of all, for his faithfulness to Christ. &#34;Theonomy in Christian Ethics&#34; started as a quite masters thesis in fulfillment of a Master of Theology degree from Westminster Theological Seminary in 1973. First published in 1977, this volume unexpectedly shook the theological establishment in its call for a return to God&#39;s law as the only perfect standard of righteousness for civil ethics. Twenty-five years later it continues to challenge the church to unashamedly embrace the &#34;Word of God, contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the only rule of faith and life.&#34; This 25th anniversary edition of &#34;Theonomy in Christian Ethics&#34; offers a third preface by Dr. Kenneth L. Gentry, Jr., a larger, reformatted page over previous editions, and a few minor changes and added notes. The inclusion of the CD rom with this book offers not only an e-book form of &#34;Theonomy&#34;, but also many other resources by Dr. Bahnsen related to the topic of Christian ethics.</p><p>It is only because of God that I have life and a life that is meaningful. Without at all losing sighof the tremendous distinction between Creator and creature, I would rather say that God is my meaning and God is my life. "In Him we live and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28). I can make a list of all the really important things that have happened to me throughout my life and career - all of the special moments of accomplishments, all of the things which have communicated joy or dignity or purpose, all of the things which have deep meaning for my life - and over against that list, I still say from the bottom of my heart, "Whom have I in heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You. My flesh and my heart fail; but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever" (Psalm 73:25). <p>With the simple and few wrds that I have, then, I would say that God has always been to me an inescapable and holy presence (cf. David's testimony in Psalm 139). God has been a secret source of personal acceptance and forgiveness, when at times there were doubts about any human source of the same. God has been a stabilizing strength as well as the fire of eagerness, whether in negative situations of adversity or positive mes of opportunity. God has been my ideal of moral perfection and, thus, both a constant rebuke to my falling short of His glory and a gentle guide in the right direction. God has been the sovereign and incomprehensible governor of every detail of my life - something which has (ironically to those who dispute such a portrayal of Him) filled me with a sense of freedom and understanding. </p><p>There is no religion for me apart from the historical work of the Son of God, applied to me in the power of the Holy Spirit. The story of Christ's incarnation, life, miracles, teaching, self-sacrificial death, powerful resurrection and glorious ascension is to me the story of stories - the historical truth which provides the paradigm for interpreting everything about myself. Life has been for me, on a day to day basis, a matter of seeing ever more fuller, deeper, and clearer how that saving story provides the integration and meaning of everything that has happened to me - of everything I am or hope to be. Many years ago I chose as a testimony verse Galatians 2:20. I understand better now than thn how appropriate it was. "I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless, I live. Yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me." - Greg L. Bahnsen</p>Dr. Greg L. Bahnsen, one of the most effective Christian apologists of the twentieth century, consistently underscored the abiding authority of the word of God and the requirement to apply it to all olife. In addition to apologetics, his seminarl work, "Theonomy in Christian Ethics", is still challenging the church to honor all of God's word as the only perfect standard of righteousness. <p>Known for his rigorous logic and theological depth, Dr. Bahnsen's scholarship and teaching always delivered sixteen ounces to the pound. His intellectual gifts and debating skills won many devoted friends - and foes. The hard work of the theological precision is rarely accomplished without controversy. Nevertheless, Bahnsen's love the Christ and His church enabled him to press on through the inevitable battles. Bearing the standard of God's word as the only inerrant rule by which men must live, Bahnsen stood fast and firm in a day of ethical relativism and ecclesiastical compromise. </p><p>On December 11, 1995, Dr. Bahnsen, 47, was taken home to be with the Lord. This festschrift seeks to pay homage to the enormous contribution Dr. Bahnsen offered to the Christian church - a contribution that has strengthened and will continue to strengthen citizens in the kingdom of God. Each of the contribors to this volume owes a debt of love and gratitude to Dr. Bahnsen not only for the labor and instruction he provided but also for his friendship and affection.</p></p><h2>Rembrandt. the Complete Paintings</h2><p><p>The Dutch Golden Age of painting spawned some of history&#x2019;s greatest artists and artisans, but few can boast the genius and legacy of Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn (1606&#x2013;1669). Despite never leaving his native Netherlands, Rembrandt projected his oeuvre past the boundaries of his own experience, producing some of art&#x2019;s most diverse and impactful works across portraiture, biblical, allegorical, landscape, and genre scenes. In all their forms, Rembrandt&#x2019;s paintings are built of intricacies&#x2015;the totality of each subtle facial wrinkle, gaze, or figure amounting to an emotional force that stands unmatched among his contemporaries and artistic progeny alike.Each work is imbued with feeling. Biblical scenes, like Bathsheba at her Bath, become vehicles for meditations on human longing, probing depths beyond that which is canonized in scripture or depicted in other representations. His portraits, be them of wealthy patrons or tradesmen, communicate the essence of an individual through fine demarcations, their faces bathed in an ethereal light against darkened earthtones. Perhaps most striking, his series of self-portraits is a triumph of the medium; beginning in his youth and spanning until a year prior to his death, Rembrandt&#x2019;s self portraiture is an intimate glimpse into his lifelong process of self-reflection.</p><p>On the occasion of the 350th anniversary of the artist&#x2019;s death, this XXL monograph compiles all 330 of Rembrandt&#x2019;s paintings in stunning reproductions. From Belshazzar&#x2019;s Feast to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, we discover Rembrandt&#x2019;s painted oeuvre like never before.</p></p><p>Volker Manuth studied art history, philosophy and classical archaeology in Kiel, Bonn, and Berlin.

She was exhausted, for one thing&#x2014;or had been before she&#x2019;d seen just about everything Veck had to offer.</p><p>Take out the <i>just</i>.</p><p>One bene was that she was really frickin&#x2019; awake now, thank you very much&#x2014;she might as well have licked two fingers and shoved them into a socket: a full-frontal like that was enough to give her the perm she&#x2019;d wanted back when she was thirteen.</p><p>Muttering to herself, she dropped her hands into her lap again. And gee whiz, as she stared at the dash, all she saw... was everything she&#x2019;d seen.</p><p>Yeah, wow, on some men, no clothes was so much more than just <i>naked</i>.</p><p>And to think she&#x2019;d almost missed the show. She&#x2019;d parked her unmarked and just called in her position when the upstairs lights had gone on and she had gotten a gander at the vista of a bedroom. Easing back into her seat, it hadn&#x2019;t dawned on her exactly where the unobstructed view was going to take them both&#x2014;she&#x2019;d just been interested that it appeared to be nothing but a bald lightbulb on the ceiling of what had to be the master suite.</p><p>Then again, bachelor pad decorating tended to be either storage-unit crammed or Death Valley&#x2013;barren.</p><p>Veck&#x2019;s was obviously the Death Valley variety.</p><p>Except suddenly she hadn&#x2019;t been thinking about interior decorating, because her suspect had stepped into the bathroom and flipped the switch.</p><p>Hellllllllo, big boy.</p><p>In too many ways to count.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop thinking about it... stop thinking about&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Closing her eyes again didn&#x2019;t help: If she&#x2019;d reluctantly noticed before how well he filled out his clothes, now she knew exactly why. He was heavily muscled, and given that he didn&#x2019;t have any hair on his chest, there was nothing to obscure those hard pecs and that six-pack and the carved ridges that went over his hips.</p><p>Matter of fact, when it came to manscaping, all he had was a dark stripe that ran between his belly button and his...</p><p>You know, maybe size did matter, she thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, for chrissakes.&#x201d;</p><p>In an attempt to get her brain focused on something, anything more appropriate, she leaned forward and looked out the opposite window. As far as she could tell, the house directly across from him had privacy shades across every available view. Good move, assuming he paraded around like that every night.</p><p>Then again, maybe the husband had strung those puppies up so that his wife didn&#x2019;t get a case of the swoons.</p><p>Bracing herself, she glanced back at Veck&#x2019;s place. The lights were off upstairs and she had to hope now that he was dressed and on the first floor, he stayed that way.</p><p>God, what a night.</p><p>Was it possible Veck had torn apart that suspect? She didn&#x2019;t think so.</p><p>But he did&#x2014;even though he couldn&#x2019;t remember a thing.</p><p>Whatever, she was still waiting for any evidence that came from the scene, and there were coyotes in those woods. Bears. Cats of the non&#x2013;Meow Mix variety. Chances were good that the suspect had come walking through there with the scent of dried blood on his clothes and something with four paws had viewed him as a Happy Meal. Veck could well have tried to step in and been shoved to the side. After all, he&#x2019;d been rubbing his temples like he&#x2019;d had pain there, and God knew head trauma had been known to cause short-term memory loss.</p><p>The lack of physical evidence on him supported the theory; that was for sure.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>God, that father of his. It was impossible not to factor him in even a little.</p><p>Like every criminal justice major, she&#x2019;d studied Thomas DelVecchio Sr. as part of her courses&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d also spent considerable time on him in her deviant-psych classes. Veck&#x2019;s dad was your classic serial killer: smart, cunning, committed to his &#x201c;craft,&#x201d; utterly remorseless. And yet, having watched videos of his interviews with police, he came across as handsome, compelling, and affable. Classy. Very non-monster.</p><p>But then again, like a lot of psychopaths, he&#x2019;d cultivated an image and sustained it with care. He&#x2019;d been very successful as a dealer of antiquities, although his establishment in that haughty, lofty world of money and privilege had been a complete self-invention. He&#x2019;d come from absolutely nothing, but had had a knack for charming rich people&#x2014;as well as a talent for going overseas and coming back with ancient artifacts and statues that were extremely marketable. It wasn&#x2019;t until the killings had started to surface that his business practices came under scrutiny, and to this day, no one had any idea where he&#x2019;d found the stuff he had&#x2014;it was almost as if he&#x2019;d had a treasure trove somewhere in the Middle East. He certainly hadn&#x2019;t helped authorities sort things out, but what were they going to do to him? He was already on death row.</p><p>Not for much longer, though, evidently.</p><p>What had Veck&#x2019;s mother been like&#x2014;</p><p>The knock on the window next to her head was like a shot ringing out, and she had her weapon palmed and pointed to the sound less than a heartbeat afterward.</p><p>Veck was standing in the street next to her car, his hands up, his wet hair glossy in the streetlights.</p><p>Lowering her weapon, she put her window down with a curse.</p><p>&#x201c;Quick reflexes, Officer,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want to get shot, Detective?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said your name. Twice. You were deep in thought.&#x201d;</p><p>Thanks to what she&#x2019;d seen in that bathroom, the flannel shirt and academy sweats he had on seemed eminently removable, the kind of duds that wouldn&#x2019;t resist a shove up or a pull down. But come on, like she hadn&#x2019;t seen every aisle in his grocery store already?</p><p>&#x201c;You want my clothes now?&#x201d; he said as he held up a trash bag.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, thank you.&#x201d; She accepted the load through her window and put the things down on the floor. &#x201c;Boots, too?&#x201d;</p><p>As he nodded, he said, &#x201c;Can I bring you some coffee? I don&#x2019;t have much in my kitchen, but I think I can find a clean mug and I got instant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a pause. &#x201c;There a reason you&#x2019;re not looking me in the eye, Officer?&#x201d;</p><p>I just saw you buck naked, Detective. &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; She pegged him right in the peepers. &#x201c;You should get inside. It&#x2019;s chilly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The cold doesn&#x2019;t bother me. You going to be here all night?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Depends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On whether I am, right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded, and then glanced around casually like they were nothing but neighbors chatting about the weather. So calm. So confident. Just like his father.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I be honest with you?&#x201d; he said abruptly.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better be, Detective.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still surprised you let me go.&#x201d;</p><p>She ran her hands around the steering wheel. &#x201c;May I be honest with you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I let you go because I really don&#x2019;t think you did it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was at the scene and I had blood on me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You called nine-one-one, you didn&#x2019;t leave, and that kind of death is very messy to perpetrate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I cleaned up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t a shower in those woods as far as I saw.&#x201d;</p><p>Do. Not. Think. Of. Him. Naked.</p><p>When he started to shake his head like he was going to argue, Reilly cut him off. &#x201c;Why are you trying to convince me I&#x2019;m wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>That shut him up. At least for a moment. Then he said in a low voice, &#x201c;Are you going to feel safe tailing me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>For the first time, emotion bled through his cool expression, and her heart stopped: There was fear in his eyes, as if he didn&#x2019;t trust himself.</p><p>&#x201c;Veck,&#x201d; she said softly, &#x201c;is there anything I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>He crossed his arms over that big chest of his and his weight went back and forth on his hips as if he were thinking. Then he hissed, and started rubbing his temple.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got nothing,&#x201d; he muttered. &#x201c;Listen, just do us both a favor, Officer. Keep that gun close by.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t look back as he turned and walked across the street.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t wearing any shoes, she realized.</p><p>Putting up the window, she watched him go into the house and shut the door. Then the lights in the house went out, except for the hallway on the second floor.</p><p>Settling in, she eased down in her seat and stared at all those windows. Shortly thereafter, a massive shadow walked into the living room&#x2014;or rather, appeared to be dragging something? Like a couch?</p><p>Then Veck sat down and his head disappeared as if he were stretching out on something.</p><p>It was almost like they were sleeping side by side. Well, except for the walls of the house, the stretch of scruffy spring lawn, the sidewalk, the asphalt, and the steel cage of her Crown Victoria.</p><p>Reilly&#x2019;s lids drifted down, but that was a function of the angle of her head. She wasn&#x2019;t tired and she wasn&#x2019;t worried about falling asleep. She was wide-awake in the dark interior of the car.</p><p>And yet she reached over and hit the door-lock button.</p><p>Just in case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Laying his hands on Mahone&#x2019;s bloody chest, Caleb closed his eyes. Bullets still fired around him, some coming too damn close. Damn it, Riley&#x2019;s men had to get out before the gas reached them in the crawl space. &#x201c;Get out!&#x201d; he yelled.</p><p>&#x201c;The vampire teleported,&#x201d; Riley shouted. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re clear.&#x201d;</p><p>With a sigh of relief, Caleb willed his consciousness into a trance and called to his ancestors for their healing help. He saw them in the colors that swirled behind his eyelids and felt their presence in the heat that immediately suffused his body. Their voices chanted, low and soothing, directing him to keep one hand directly over Mahone&#x2019;s heart and the other over his eyes. Caleb willed the healing heat building within his body to transfer to Mahone. As it did, he took some of Mahone&#x2019;s pain into himself.</p><p>He felt his own heartbeat slow.</p><p>His limbs weakened.</p><p>His body began to shake with the effort of remaining upright, and he forced even breaths, sensing he needed to maintain contact far longer than he ever had.</p><p>Come on, come on, he urged himself. Hang in there.</p><p>The dizziness came next. Then the nausea. He could feel his lungs filling with the gas that swirled around them and knew his time was running out.</p><p>His body jerked as he coughed, and the movement threatened to pull his hands away from Mahone.</p><p>They had to get out of there, but if he disconnected too soon, it would all be for nothing. Mahone would die. Hell, Caleb would probably die, as well, too weak from the healing to get out on his own.</p><p>But then he felt Mahone&#x2019;s chest rising strongly and his pulse beating regularly, and he knew the healing had worked. The heat slowly left his body, and the voices of his ancestors faded. Caleb whispered his thanks, then opened his eyes. Swiftly, he reached up and unhooked Mahone&#x2019;s chains from the manacles around his wrists. Mahone groaned and slumped over just as Caleb caught him and threw him fireman-style over his shoulder.</p><p>Caleb staggered a few steps before he turned, intending to carry Mahone to the doorway. Halfway there, his knees buckled. He lost his grip on Mahone, and the man slipped and rolled a couple of feet away. Grunting, Caleb fell on all fours, his head hanging, his lungs seizing up.</p><p>He&#x2019;d waited too long. They were both going to die in this warehouse, just like the FBI scientists who&#x2019;d discovered the vamp antidote only to be killed because of it. He looked up, eyes watering, searching the room, thankful that Team Blue had obeyed his orders even as he regretted the fact no one was going to be able to help him.</p><p>But then he saw her. Wraith. Running toward him. He tried to open his mouth. To yell at her to stop.</p><p>His heart squeezed. Damn her for putting herself at such risk. He didn&#x2019;t know how the gas would affect a wraith. Since it worked so well on vamps, immortality had nothing to do with the effects. But he couldn&#x2019;t make a sound, and Wraith kept coming. She knelt beside him and pulled him up. She was yelling something, and he tried to make it out.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . have to walk! I need to get Mahone. Can you walk, O&#x2019;Flare?&#x201d;</p><p>She was glancing frantically between him and Mahone, the indecision on her face readily apparent. She couldn&#x2019;t carry them both out of there before the gas ended them.</p><p>&#x201c;Leave me . . .&#x201d; he tried to say, but again no sound came out. It didn&#x2019;t matter. Wraith understood.</p><p>She grabbed him by his shirt and shook him, hanging on when he began to slide, practically keeping him on his feet. &#x201c;No fucking way, O&#x2019;Flare. I didn&#x2019;t survive Korea just to come back and lose you in the States. Stay on your feet and move. You&#x2019;re walking out of here. Got it?&#x201d;</p><p>The vehemence in her voice roused him enough to nod. She released him, and although he swayed on his feet, he didn&#x2019;t fall. Quickly, she grabbed Mahone, carrying him in the same lift O&#x2019;Flare had used. Then, amazingly, she positioned herself next to him and ordered, &#x201c;Lean against me if you need to. Start walking. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>Caleb walked. He didn&#x2019;t know how he did it, but he managed to put one foot in front of the other. At one point, he did have to lean on her, and he sensed how it slowed her down, but she didn&#x2019;t move away. She stayed with him.</p><p>Until they made it out into the open air. He heard shouts and the sound of stomping feet just as he collapsed.</p><p>When he came to, he was being loaded into an ambulance. Riley&#x2019;s face hovered above him. &#x201c;Mahone?&#x201d; Caleb rasped out.</p><p>&#x201c;Still alive,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know if he&#x2019;s going to stay that way.&#x201d;</p><p>From the worried expression on the man&#x2019;s face, Caleb knew his own chance of survival was also in question.</p><p>&#x201c;Wraith?&#x201d; he asked, grabbing on to the man&#x2019;s shirt when he didn&#x2019;t answer. &#x201c;What about the wraith?&#x201d;</p><p>Riley shook his head. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. She passed out, same as you. No pulse, remember? No breath. No way to tell if she&#x2019;s alive or dead. They took her in another cab. Your guess is as good as mine.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Ethnic Studies: Critical Fundamentals</h2><p>ETHNIC STUDIES: CRITICAL FUNDAMENTALS is a balanced interdisciplinary textbook for introductory ethnic studies courses, incorporating the very latest research in critical race studies, sociology, history, psychology, and anthropology.

Wommack reveals that God's power is not released from only grace or only faith. God's blessings come through a balance of both grace and faith.</p> <p>Addressing many of the misconceptions believers are taught in the Church today, this book opens up the Scriptures revealing the vital connection between grace and faith. Many believers think they walk in both grace and faith when actually they are misusing one or both of these principles. Wommack addresses: </p><ul><li>Some believers willingly sin believing God�s grace will cover them, while the blessing of grace is not to sin, but to release guilt and condemnation when they make a mistake.</li> <li>Other believers think they must "work" their faith by ritualistic prayer, confession, or Bible study. Although all these things are good, Jesus Christ set believers free from works of the law. God wants a relationship where He can communicate directly to each believer.</li> <li>Grace and faith work together. When believers receive the unmerited favor or grace of God, they can release their faith without doubt or reservation and receive God's blessings. </li></ul> <p>Andrew Wommack in his logical, practical style brings believers back on track in their Christian walk through living in the balance of grace and faith.</p></p><p>For over three decades Andrew Wommack has traveled America and the world teaching the truth of the gospel. His profound revelation of the Word of God is taught with clarity and simplicity, emphasizing God s unconditional love and the balance between grace and faith. He reaches millions of people through the daily Gospel Truth radio and television programs, broadcast both domestically and internationally. Gospel Truth television broadcast can be seen on INSP, DayStar, The Church Channel, Cornerstone, Guardian, God TV, and over 80 local US channels. Gospel Truth radio broadcast is heard on more than 60 stations nationwide. Andrew Wommack founded Charis Bible College in 1994 and has since established CBC extension colleges in other major cities of America and around the world. Andrew has produced a library of teaching materials, available in print, audio, and visual formats. And, as it has been from the beginning, his ministry continues to distribute free audio tapes and CD&#39;s to those who cannot afford them.</p><h2>Computer Security Fundamentals (Pearson IT Cybersecurity Curriculum)</h2><p><p>Clearly explains core concepts, terminology, challenges, technologies, and skills</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Covers today&#x2019;s latest attacks and countermeasures </p> <p> <br> </p> <p>The perfect beginner&#x2019;s guide for anyone interested in a computer security career</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Dr. Chuck Easttom brings together complete coverage of all basic concepts, terminology, and issues, along with all the skills you need to get started.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Drawing on 30 years of experience as a security instructor, consultant, and researcher, Easttom helps you take a proactive, realistic approach to assessing threats and implementing countermeasures.

The night was almost a navy blue, with so many stars overhead it would be impossible to count them. The moon was rising, a beautiful half-crescent of shining light. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfection. Everything I dreamed of.&#x201d;</p><p>Her wedding night. She&#x2019;d dreamt of it for so long. At last, this was the evening she&#x2019;d waited for, and the weather was cooperating, just as if it knew she was marrying the man of her dreams.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to get you ready, Gabby,&#x201d; Joie answered. &#x201c;Come back here. I need to make certain you have everything you need and give you the &#x2018;talk.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle turned back with a short laugh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m marrying Gary, Joie, the love of my life. I certainly don&#x2019;t need the &#x2018;talk.&#x2019; I love Gary Jansen with every breath in my body,&#x201d; she whispered, as her sister smoothed a hand down the filmy ivory and lace gown and stepped back to survey her handiwork.</p><p>&#x201c;Daratrazanoff,&#x201d; Joie corrected, a hint of worry in her voice. &#x201c;You still persist in acting as if you&#x2019;re human, Gabrielle. You aren&#x2019;t. Neither is Gary. Both of you are fully Carpathian. When Gary rose Carpathian, he rose as a true Daratrazanoff. He&#x2019;s from one of the most powerful lineages the Carpathian people have. You can&#x2019;t pretend he isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still Gary,&#x201d; Gabrielle protested gently. She took both of her sister&#x2019;s hands in hers. &#x201c;Be happy for me. Truly, I&#x2019;ve never been happier than this night. We waited so long to be together.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am happy for you,&#x201d; Joie said immediately, smiling at her sister. &#x201c;You look so beautiful. Like a princess.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle looked at herself in the mirror. Her dress was exactly right. The perfect fit, a lovely fall to her ankles, swirling around her so that she appeared to be ethereal. She loved the square lace neckline and the fitted bodice showing off her small waist. She was tall enough to pull off elegant, and the gown did just that.</p><p>Joie didn&#x2019;t understand. None of them did. Only Gary. He knew. He saw inside of her. Way down deep where no one else had ever looked.</p><p>&#x201c;Joie, I&#x2019;m not like you or Jubal,&#x201d; she admitted, referring to her brother. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a woman who craves adventure. I&#x2019;m not a warrior who wants to go fight the injustices of the world. I&#x2019;m just Gabrielle, no one special, and I like my life simple. Peaceful. I like to sing when I wake up and hum all day long. I like picnics. Horses. Galloping across the fields and jumping over tree trunks and streams. I love sitting on a porch swing and talking quietly with someone I love. That someone is Gary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Gabby.&#x201d; Joie put her arms around Gabrielle. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize you&#x2019;ve been so unhappy. You have, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle hugged Joie back, feeling lucky to have a sister and brother who loved her so much. She felt their love at all times. Their support. More than anything, she wanted Joie&#x2019;s support now in the biggest moment of her life.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t fit in this world, Joie,&#x201d; she said gently, trying to find a way to carefully explain. Joie pulled back and looked at her with liquid eyes. Gabrielle&#x2019;s heart beat louder. She didn&#x2019;t want to hurt her sister, but she wanted to be honest. &#x201c;I like to observe people from a distance, not be in the middle of some kind of crazy battle between vampires and shifters. I didn&#x2019;t even know there were such things as shifters or vampires in the world. Carpathians. Lycans. Mages. Jaguars. It&#x2019;s all crazy, like a mad nightmare, Joie. Violence and war aren&#x2019;t big on my agenda. In fact, the entire Carpathian way of life is totally foreign to my nature.&#x201d;</p><p>She had, thankfully, never heard of Carpathians when she was growing up. And she&#x2019;d always thought vampires were a myth. She still wished she thought that. Carpathians never killed for blood, but they slept in the rejuvenating ground, couldn&#x2019;t be in the sunlight, and existed on blood. They hunted the vampires who lived to kill their victims.</p><p>Gabrielle gave a little shiver. She&#x2019;d had enough of battles. Of wars. Of seeing someone she loved&#x2014;such as Gary&#x2014;nearly lose his life when it wasn&#x2019;t even his fight. She had nearly lost him. Gregori had converted him, bringing him fully into the Carpathian world&#x2014;as if they hadn&#x2019;t already brought him there.</p><p>Gary had somehow become an integral part of Carpathian life, so essential to them that even the prince sought his opinion on matters Carpathian. Gregori, second to the prince, was always with Gary now. It wasn&#x2019;t as if Gary was born a Daratrazanoff. He was born Gary Jansen, a genius, off the charts intelligent, a tall, thin reed of a man with glasses and a thirst for knowledge. A geek. Like her.</p><p>Now he was a tall, completely filled out, walking warrior. He went into battles without flinching. Even before Gregori had converted him he had. She&#x2019;d watched him slowly change from her nerdy geek to a completely different man as the Carpathians put more and more demands on him.</p><p>Joie moved to a chair as if Gabrielle was delivering a terrible blow, and she probably was. She hadn&#x2019;t told anyone but Gary her true feelings. Her beloved Gary. He was quiet and solid. He could always, <i>always</i>, be counted on. Everyone counted on him, but especially Gabrielle.</p><p>She kept trying to make her sister understand. &#x201c;Joie, you and Jubal belong in the Carpathian world. I don&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t even want to be here. Not anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie inhaled sharply. &#x201c;Gabby&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle shook her head. This had to be said. She wanted Joie to understand just what Gary meant to her. What he&#x2019;d been for her in the past and what he would be in her future. &#x201c;I hope, after tonight, after I marry Gary, we&#x2019;ll go away together and live in a beautiful little house. Nothing big. Nothing fancy. Just small and snug and filled with love. That&#x2019;s it. That&#x2019;s my dream. Gary and my little house tucked away someplace where there are no such things as vampires and women carry their children to full term and give birth to healthy, happy babies. No wars. Just peace and happiness.&#x201d;</p><p>There, she&#x2019;d said it. That was the strict truth, and Joie needed to know how she truly felt.</p><p>Joie&#x2019;s eyebrows came together as she frowned. &#x201c;You mean you want to move away from here? Where your laboratory is set up? You love working here. You want to move away from the Carpathian Mountains? From the prince? From Gregori?&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin. &#x201c;<i>Especially</i> away from the prince and Gregori.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie shook her head, looking shocked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t belong in the Carpathian world, I just don&#x2019;t. Only Gary seems to understand that about me. He doesn&#x2019;t mind that I&#x2019;m not a fierce warrior woman. The thing is, Joie, I don&#x2019;t <i>want</i> to be different. I&#x2019;m a book person. I like to live quietly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gabrielle, you are so far off track about yourself and Gary. Where is this coming from? You love adventures. You&#x2019;ve gone ice climbing with Jubal and me a million times. You&#x2019;ve gone caving. Hiking in remote, third world countries.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle nodded. &#x201c;I went caving because you and Jubal did, and I enjoy spending time with you, but I don&#x2019;t live for adventures the way you do. I&#x2019;m really a homebody.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you crazy, Gabby? You&#x2019;re a genius who thrives on studying hot viruses. Newsflash, sister. Playing with that kind of virus without a way to fight it can get you killed. If you didn&#x2019;t like adventure you would never, under any circumstances, study them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You fight the world&#x2019;s injustices your way, and I fight them mine. Viruses make sense to me. I can solve the puzzle and try to help with things like finding a way to stop the Ebola virus from being let loose on the world. Vampires make no sense. None.&#x201d; She gave a little shudder. Joie would never understand that she escaped into a lab, that once she focused on whatever she was studying, everything around her disappeared and she didn&#x2019;t have to think about anything else at all.</p><p>&#x201c;You have crazy, mad skills in a lab, Gabby,&#x201d; Joie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a genius, it isn&#x2019;t just Gary. He isn&#x2019;t smarter than you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually he is. Most men bore me silly after two minutes alone in their company. I can talk to Gary for hours. More, I can just listen to him when he talks to others. He&#x2019;s brilliant. He&#x2019;s also the kindest, sweetest man I know.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie shook her head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Daratrazanoff. Every bit of power, of knowledge, their blood, their ancestors, all of it was given to him in the cave of warriors. You know that. You were there. He was powerful before, Gabby. He&#x2019;s even more so now.&#x201d;</p><p>Gary always took the back of the hunters and he&#x2019;d never let any of them down during a battle, not once. Gabrielle knew it because when he&#x2019;d nearly died, their best hunters came in to give blood and to pay their respects. She knew it because Gregori Daratrazanoff had made him his brother, his own flesh and blood. The power of the Daratrazanoff family ran in his veins. Was in his heart and soul. Was there, in his mind.</p><p>Okay, she had to admit to herself she shied a little away from the sheer power there at times, but still, he was always her Gary. Gentle and kind with her. Seeing her when others couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;or wouldn&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;d tried to tell Joie and Jubal that she was different, not at all wild or willful, but they laughed and said she didn&#x2019;t know herself very well.</p><p>Maybe she didn&#x2019;t. But she knew what she wanted&#x2014;what she&#x2019;d always wanted&#x2014;and that was Gary. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what his last name is, or whose blood runs in his veins, he&#x2019;s <i>mine</i>,&#x201d; she declared firmly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s always been mine, and I want him back. His life shouldn&#x2019;t be fighting vampires. He&#x2019;s such a genius and I miss him in the laboratory. I want him back there. Once we&#x2019;re married and we find a home, we can set up a lab and he can research for solutions to all the Carpathians&#x2019; problems <i>away</i> from the Carpathian Mountains and vampires and anything else that is monstrous.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie cleared her throat, and Gabrielle&#x2019;s gaze jumped to her younger sister.</p><p>&#x201c;Just tell me, Joie,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve always talked straight with each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t change him, Gabby. Gary is a man who will put himself in harm&#x2019;s way over and over if it comes to his sense of right or wrong. He has a clear sense of honor, of duty, and that&#x2019;s why Gregori accepted him from the start&#x2014;from the very beginning when he first met Gary. Gregori didn&#x2019;t associate with humans, but Gary already had the same values. He was willing to put himself on the line. Like Gregori, he&#x2019;s a man of action, and he&#x2019;s decisive about it.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabrielle shook her head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve forced him to become like them. He belongs in a laboratory. He loves research and he&#x2019;s got the mind for it, Joie. You know he does, but more and more they&#x2019;re pulling him off that work to go hunt the vampire with them. He&#x2019;s with the prince and Gregori all the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because they value his advice, Gabby,&#x201d; Joie said gently. &#x201c;You should be proud of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am, superproud,&#x201d; Gabrielle assured her sister, and she <i>was</i> proud of Gary. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a brain. <i>Gregori</i> changed him.&#x201d;</p><p>Joie bit down on her lip, her eyes shadowed. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t, Gabby. Gregori wouldn&#x2019;t have changed him&#x2014;he couldn&#x2019;t. Fundamentally, Gary is the same man he always was. Gregori looked into his mind and he saw a brother&#x2014;a man who thinks as he thinks. Gregori accepted Gary because Gary is exactly like he is. Of course Gary didn&#x2019;t have the skills or knowledge to fight the undead, but he does now. He is Carpathian through and through. You have to be very sure you know him and you accept who he is, not just a small part of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They almost got him killed. In a way they <i>did</i> get him killed.&#x201d; She ducked her head and twisted her fingers together. &#x201c;I was there when he was dying. I was <i>right</i> there. Do you know what he said when Gregori told him he was going to convert him? Gregori explained that Gary was <i>dying</i>. We all knew.&#x201d;</p><p>She pressed a trembling hand to her mouth as the memories flooded in, the ones she tried so hard to keep at bay. She actually felt sick to her stomach. Her lungs refused air and her heart accelerated to the point where she was afraid she might have a heart attack. She would never forget the sight of Gary, torn and bloody in so many places. He&#x2019;d saved the life of Zev Hunter, lifemate to Branislava of the Dragonseekers. Zev was <i>H�n ku pes�k&nbsp;kaikak</i>&#x2014;guardian of all and a very needed member of their people. But in saving Zev&#x2019;s life, Gary nearly died. So close. It had been a terrible few hours. The worst. She never wanted to go through that again.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t a healer like some of the women. That wasn&#x2019;t her gift. She didn&#x2019;t even know what her gift was other than a party trick or two. So she could look at a map and locate things. What good was that? Her family&#x2014;and the Carpathians&#x2014;said she was psychic, but she wasn&#x2019;t. Not like Joie, not like Jubal. She was just plain Gabrielle. No one special. But Gary was a gift, and he saw her that way as well. She&#x2019;d nearly lost him to the madness of Carpathian life.</p><p>&#x201c;He said he could better serve the people as human,&#x201d; she whispered, her fingers covering her mouth as if she couldn&#x2019;t say the words aloud. &#x201c;He was ready to die for them. He didn&#x2019;t make the decision to become Carpathian. Gregori made it for him.&#x201d;</p><p>There was hurt in her voice. She knew Joie heard it. The Carpathian people had been put above her. Everything in her life had changed when she&#x2019;d been nearly killed. A member of a human society of vampire killers had stabbed her repeatedly, a vicious, brutal attack. She still had nightmares, although she didn&#x2019;t share that with anyone, not even Gary. She had been brought into the Carpathian world in order to save her life.</p><p>Had it not been for Gary, she would have wished they hadn&#x2019;t saved her. She didn&#x2019;t belong. It was that simple. Mikhail, the prince of the Carpathian people, had given her the choice. Live or die. Of course, it had been her own decision to be converted, but Gary was a huge part of that. She&#x2019;d never had regrets because of him. At the time, terrified and in pain, she had been happy for the chance. Mostly, because she knew <i>this </i>day would come. Her day. The day she married Gary.</p><p>&#x201c;Gabby,&#x201d; Joie said. Her tone said it all. Compassionate. Sympathetic.</p><p>Gabrielle blinked back tears. &#x201c;I know he has a sense of duty. I know that. I love that about him. When we&#x2019;re bound together as lifemates, my soul to his, that sense of absolute duty and honor and love will be for me. I&#x2019;ll be first. Traian puts you first. Even Gregori puts Savannah first. Lifemates are always first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re absolutely certain that Gary is the one for you, Gabrielle?&#x201d; Joie asked.</p><p>Gabrielle had always chosen to think before she spoke, especially to her sister and brother. She loved them both fiercely. She turned what Joie said over and over in her mind. Was she fooling herself? Was her love for Gary real? Did she see him the way he saw her? Because she knew, without a doubt, Gary saw her. Inside of her. He knew her better than anyone else had ever known her.</p><p>She moistened her lips. She had never really used her abilities as a Carpathian to look into Gary&#x2019;s mind. That was true. She could. He would have allowed it, but she wanted that human aspect of finding out slowly about her partner. She even needed it. ...</p></p><h2>Breathwalk: Breathing Your Way to a Revitalized Body, Mind and Spirit</h2><p>Breathing and walking comprise two of our simplest activities, yet they are also two of our most powerful actions.

Born in India on January 5, 1893, he devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Daya Mata, one of his earliest and closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 1955. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.&#34;Yogananda dispels the notion held by most people that direct contact with God is beyond their reach....Millions of readers who were introduced to the spiritual wisdom of the East through &#34;Autobiography of a Yogi.,.&#34;will find the same deep inspiration and wisdom in the pages of &#34;How You Can Talk with God.&#34; -- Reviewer &#34;Arkansas State Press (Little Rock)&#34;</p><h2>Theater Games for the Lone Actor</h2><p>This handbook presents theatre games and side coaching for the solo player.

Available for the first time, this handbook presents more than forty exercises that allow actors to side coach themselves at home, in rehearsal, or in performance. Building on her seminal Improvisation for the Theater, Spolin challenges the actor to develop an ability to enter present time, "a moment of full consciousness, awareness, continuous time, a timeless moment . . . with all of your responses awake and alert, ready to guide you . . . allowing you, the real you, your natural self, to emerge."<br>Spolin's improvisational techniques changed the nature and practice of modern theater. Her work has inspired actors, directors, teachers, and writers in theater, television, and film. Her techniques have also influenced the fields of education, mental health, social work, and psychology. <br>Viola Spolin, the originator of theater games, was introduced to the use of games, storytelling, folk dance, and dramatics as tools for stimulating creative expression in the 1920s while a student of Neva Boyd at Chicago's Hull House. During her years as a teacher and supervisor of creative dramatics there, she began to develop her nonverbal, nonpsychological approach. Her books have been translated into Swedish, German, and Portuguese. She died in 1994. <p></p>Paul Sills is Viola Spolin's son and the founding director of Chicago's Second City and of Story Theater.

He lives with his wife outside of Chicago.K-Gr 3-In the tradition of classic cartoon-art picture books, this gem tells a fun, slapstick story while teaching the basic physics of buoyancy and Archimedes's principle. Archie the Goat wants to devise a method of crossing the moat to the castle. His friend Skinny the Hen suggests simply taking the drawbridge, but Archie prefers a challenge and sets out to build a contraption to float. The entertaining spot art done with pen-and-ink and watercolor is full of energy and movement, drawing out the humor in the punchy text. Using barrels of buttermilk, Archie tries to make it across the moat. All day and into the night, much puzzling and experimenting results in a dripping goat and a far less skinny hen. Finally, Archie gets it right and floats across to meet a very frustrated porcine queen who wants to know what happened to the rest of her buttermilk. An author's note further explains buoyancy and wonderful barrel endpapers complete the package. This story will liven up any science class and also hold its own as a spirited pleasure read.-Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

Three months, four days, and approximately six hours.<br> <br>The problem wasn&#x2019;t the sixteen-year age difference. It wasn&#x2019;t even that she was his professor and he was her teaching assistant. The problem was that Sheila was engaged to Morris, and now the affair with Ethan had to stop. No more weekly &#x201c;meetings&#x201d; at the Ivy, the motel just off campus that rented rooms by the hour. No more sneaking around. No more lying. No more falling into that chasm of depression that consumed her for days after each of their trysts.<br> <br>It had to end. All of it. Sheila and her therapist had been working hard on this. Yes, even psychologists had psychologists.<br> <br>It wouldn&#x2019;t be easy. Ethan was good-looking and prone to getting his way. Hell, he had seduced her, though Sheila suspected not even her therapist believed that.<br> <br>They were in her bright corner office on the fourth floor of the psychology building at Puget Sound State University. He was relaxed, casual, his jean-clad legs spread open in that cocky way he liked to sit. The desk between them was strewn with papers, an organized clutter that served as a makeshift barrier.<br> <br>Observing him, she watched his full lips form words she only half-heard. There was nothing vague about Ethan&#x2019;s attractiveness, but he downplayed it by wearing ratty vintage T-shirts, worn jeans, tennis shoes.

His intelligence and drive had been a big part of his appeal. They were discussing grades for her popular summer-session undergraduate social psychology class, and so far neither of them had commented as to why they were meeting here this morning, in her office, instead of room sixteen at the Ivy Motel.

He never talked with his hands, even when he was passionate about something. &#x201c;The similarities he drew between Milgram&#x2019;s experiment and the Nazis? Too obvious.&#x201d;<br> <br>His brows were furrowed. Sheila was about to overrule the grade Ethan had assigned to one of her undergraduate students, and he didn&#x2019;t like it. He wasn&#x2019;t used to it. They didn&#x2019;t disagree often.<br> <br>&#x201c;He loses points for originality, but don&#x2019;t you think his argument is solid?&#x201d; Sheila smiled to soften her words. &#x201c;This is only a sophomore class. He did what was asked of him and it was better than average. I spoke to Danny personally the other day. He risks losing his scholarship if we give him that C. He&#x2019;s a good kid. I&#x2019;d really hate to see that happen.&#x201d;<br> <br>She could almost hear the wheels in Ethan&#x2019;s mind turning as he thought of a counterargument. Most of the time she encouraged healthy debate, but she wasn&#x2019;t in the mood this morning. There was a conversation they needed to have, and she was having a hard time steering them in that direction.<br> <br>She waited, saying nothing. If she didn&#x2019;t push it, he&#x2019;d come around. The key was to let him work through it on his own.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Ethan said finally. &#x201c;You win, Sheila. Danny gets a B. Lucky bastard. God, I hate it when you assert your authority over me.&#x201d; Lowering his voice, he glanced over his shoulder at the open door behind him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to make it up to me later.&#x201d; He leaned forward and ran a finger down the back of her left hand, lips curled into the half-smile she liked so much.<br> <br>His finger brushed over the band of her new diamond ring, turned inside out so the stone was tucked into her palm. His gaze dropped down to her hand.<br> <br>She was surprised it had taken him this long to notice. <i>Here we go</i>.<br> <br>Her first instinct was to yank her hand away, but that would only make things worse. Willing herself to appear relaxed, she twisted the platinum band around. Ethan&#x2019;s eyes widened at the sight of the four-carat diamond.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; The lightness of his tone did not match his face. A flush emerged just above the neckline of his T-shirt. He touched a finger to the top of the stone, leaving a smudge.<br> <br>She resisted the urge to wipe it off. The face of a diamond this size was like glass. Morris was a senior partner at Bindle Brothers, the largest investment bank in the Northwest, and he hadn&#x2019;t held back.<br> <br>She withdrew her hand. &#x201c;Could you close the door?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Just for a few minutes. There&#x2019;s something we need to discuss.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ethan stiffened, as Sheila knew he would. He was fine in a lecture hall, but they both knew he didn&#x2019;t like closed doors in small spaces. Something to do with his childhood and getting locked in a closet for hours&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t really know, he&#x2019;d always been vague. In their tiny motel room, the windows always had to be open, even if it was raining.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just for a bit so we can talk in private. I&#x2019;ll open the window.&#x201d;<br> <br>He closed her office door reluctantly while she cranked open the casement behind her. A blast of August warmth entered the air-conditioned room. Ethan waited in silence, his expression betraying nothing.<br> <br>There was no way around it except to be direct. &#x201c;Morris and I are getting married.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ethan leaned back in his chair and stared at her with unreadable light gray eyes. Again, she waited. The thrum of the air conditioner reverberated in the room.<br> <br>&#x201c;When did this happen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Saturday.&#x201d; Five nights ago.<br> <br>He looked around the office. He wasn&#x2019;t one to avoid eye contact, so she guessed he was digesting this information. His gaze focused briefly on a small, framed picture of Sheila and Morris on the window ledge before returning to her face. &#x201c;Well, this is big news. But it doesn&#x2019;t change anything between you and me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It changes everything.&#x201d; The words were out before she could consider their impact. Biting her lip, she forged ahead anyway. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be involved with you anymore outside of class.&#x201d;<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t blink. &#x201c;Just like that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>He exhaled and she caught a whiff of the cinnamon gum he&#x2019;d been chewing earlier. He always chewed cinnamon gum, and if she closed her eyes, she could almost taste it, could almost feel his sweet, spicy tongue in her mouth&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Congratulations.&#x201d; The smile didn&#x2019;t quite touch his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;When&#x2019;s the wedding?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;October tenth.&#x201d;<br> <br>His smile turned into a grin she couldn&#x2019;t read. It wasn&#x2019;t amusement, or annoyance, or even a desire to please; it was something else entirely.<br> <br>&#x201c;So soon. Why the rush?&#x201d;<br> <br>She had prepared for this question, rehearsing the answer in her head during the drive to work that morning, and it rolled off her tongue. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirty-nine and I&#x2019;m not getting any younger. I&#x2019;m tired of living alone, Ethan. I love Morris. We want to start our life together. We&#x2014;there might still be time for kids.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What should I wear to the wedding?&#x201d;<br> <br>Shocked, she opened her mouth, but no words came out.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m kidding,&#x201d; he said, his eyes finally showing a hint of amusement. &#x201c;Joke, Sheila. I wouldn&#x2019;t come even if I was invited. Isn&#x2019;t there a rule about going to the weddings of people you used to fuck?&#x201d;<br> <br>She winced. She had no problem with cursing, but here, in this moment, it sounded unreasonably harsh.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, well. It&#x2019;s better that it&#x2019;s over anyway.&#x201d; He ran a hand through his short, mussed hair. &#x201c;It really should have ended ages ago, now that I think about it. Remember when your father died? How messed up you were?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her stomach lurched. &#x201c;Of course I remember.&#x201d; It had only been three months since her estranged father had passed away from liver cancer. Three days before the affair had started. She knew it had been the trigger.<br> <br>His voice became low, accusing. &#x201c;I never wanted this to be a long-term thing. But you were so goddamned needy. You kept telling me not to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a subtle but unmistakable slap in the face. <i>Please don&#x2019;t go</i>. Oh, yes, those had been her words exactly, words she&#x2019;d whispered to Ethan the morning after her father&#x2019;s funeral while lying next to him naked under the scratchy motel bedsheets. It hurt to think he could bring it up now as if they were talking about the weather.<br> <br>&#x201c;The timing was bad,&#x201d; he said with a shrug. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t do it to you. But really, it should have ended right after it started.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You said that already.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you mad?&#x201d; His face was open, interested. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be mad, Sheila. I don&#x2019;t regret that it lasted as long as it did. But all good things must come to an end. This won&#x2019;t change anything professional between us. We still work really well together.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sat back with a Cheshire-cat smile.<br> <br>She was suddenly infuriated. Exactly who was dumping whom here? She had agonized over this conversation for days, wondering what to say to him and how to say it, alternating between supreme bliss at her new engagement and pangs of regret over the affair, worried about hurting Morris, hurting Ethan, hurting herself. Nothing about this had been simple. Nothing.<br> <br>But here he was, easy like Sunday morning, his handsome face a mixture of pity and regret.<br> <br>She arranged the papers on the desk into neat stacks to keep her hands from trembling, thinking hard about what she wanted to say next.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right, about that.&#x201d; Sheila&#x2019;s words were tight as she forced herself to stay calm. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we should continue to work together. I&#x2019;m going to recommend you work with Dr. Easton from now on.&#x201d;<br> <br>This caught him off guard. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not fucking serious?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am.&#x201d; She smiled, pleased at his reaction, then made a grand show of wiping her brow. &#x201c;You know what, I need to close the window. It&#x2019;s really hot in here and the air-conditioning&#x2019;s escaping. You know how I get when it&#x2019;s stuffy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sheila, don&#x2019;t close&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>She stood up quickly and cranked and latched the window. By the time she turned back to Ethan, his body had gone rigid. She sat down again and crossed her legs, not bothering to hide her own little smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;I promise you it&#x2019;ll be an easy transition. Dr. Easton was impressed with the work you did in his advanced personality theory class last term. His expertise on deviant behavior can only help your thesis.&#x201d; Sheila&#x2019;s smile widened. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, the department won&#x2019;t have a problem with the switch. You can stay until the end of next term as my TA, but after Christmas&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to switch,&#x201d; he said. Beads of sweat appeared at his hairline even though the room was cooling. &#x201c;I have less than a year to go. I don&#x2019;t want to work through the kinks of a new adviser.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do everything I can to help.&#x201d;<br> <br>They sat staring at each other. It was awkward waiting out the silence, but she knew whoever spoke first would lose.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re trying to get rid of me,&#x201d; Ethan hissed. Circular sweat stains had formed at his armpits, soaking through the cloth of his gray T-shirt. &#x201c;Well, guess what, I&#x2019;m not switching. I&#x2019;ve been working with you for going on three terms now. You&#x2019;re not passing me off to someone else because you&#x2019;re getting married and don&#x2019;t want a reminder you fucked the help. My thesis is nearly done.&#x201d; He was breathing hard. Perspiration trailed down his left temple.<br> <br>She had about thirty seconds before he&#x2019;d totally lose it; claustrophobia could be debilitating. &#x201c;And I promise you nothing will change,&#x201d; she said again. &#x201c;Dr. Easton&#x2019;s always admired you and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dr. Easton&#x2019;s a fucking fag!&#x201d; Ethan slammed his hands down on the desk and the stack of term papers fell over. At that moment the air conditioner paused and the room was suddenly quiet. Pointing a finger at her, he stood up. &#x201c;I am not working with him. You <i>are</i> going to finish what you started with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sheila did her best to appear impassive. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have a choice. I can reassign you anytime I like, for any reason.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really? And what would the dean say about that?&#x201d; Ethan was towering over her desk. Little drops of sweat hit the term papers, blurring the ink into shapeless forms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dean Simmons will back me up, of course,&#x201d; she said, looking up at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Even after he sees you on the Internet taking it up the ass?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? What are you&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped. Her throat went dry and she swallowed. Her heart started thumping in her chest so hard she thought she could feel her silk blouse moving. &#x201c;You deleted that off your phone. I watched you do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure about that?&#x201d; His eyes were flat, devoid of emotion. He was still sweating but his voice was once again controlled. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t e-mail it to myself first? You&#x2019;re absolutely sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her temple began to throb. The fluorescent lights overhead were suddenly too bright, the walls too yellow, the air conditioner too loud. Her armpits tingled and she could smell onions. Ethan&#x2019;s body odor. Or was it her own?<br> <br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t dare,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d; He grinned triumphantly as he wiped his sweaty brow with his hand. Turning away from her, he finally yanked open the office door and stepped out, taking deep breaths of the semi-stale hallway air.<br> <br>Sheila sat, dazed. There was a 99 percent chance he was bluffing&#x2014;her gut told her there was no video anymore, he wouldn&#x2019;t have had time to send it somewhere else from his phone before she&#x2019;d made him delete it&#x2014;but goddamn it, it wasn&#x2019;t good enough. If anything like it ever showed up on CampusAnonymous.com, a website notorious for outrageous gossip and nasty comments about all things involving the university, she&#x2019;d be ruined. The video would go viral before she could blink twice, and two decades of hard work would be snuffed out like a campfire in a thunderstorm.<br> <br>Having an affair with a student was one thing. It happened all the time&#x2014;she could think of three professors who&#x2019;d been involved with students in the past, who&#x2019;d gotten nothing more than slaps on the wrist. And Ethan was twenty-three and neither of them were married, which counted for something.<br> <br>But a video? It wouldn&#x2019;t matter whom she was screwing&#x2014;a video of her writhing naked on the Internet would get her fired. No hearing, no chance to defend herself, just an hour to collect her personal belongings and she&#x2019;d be out the door on her ass. Do not pass Go, do not collect two hundred.<br> <br> <i>How could I have been so fucking stupid?</i> <br> <br>A voice broke into her thoughts, and she looked up. Valerie Kim, one of Sheila&#x2019;s other TAs, stood in the doorway just behind Ethan.<br> <br>&#x201c;One sec, Val,&#x201d; Ethan said to the petite young woman. His tone betrayed no hint of the tension that filled the office. &#x201c;The professor and I are almost done here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s cool.&#x201d; Valerie looked past Ethan into the office at Sheila. &#x201c;I can come back in five.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No need.&#x201d; Sheila&#x2019;s smile felt clownish. &#x201c;Come in, Valerie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ethan stepped back into the office and made a show of bundling up the scattered term papers on the desk. Slinging his worn leather bag crosswise over his torso, he grinned at Sheila. &#x201c;Dr. Tao, I&#x2019;ll see you next week. Thanks for your time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Sheila said. Her shoulders slumped and her back ached.<br> <br>Ethan winked at Valerie as he left the office. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s all yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>She heard him whistling as he ambled down the hallway, not a care in the world, and her mind reele...</p><h2>Finns of Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula (Images of America)</h2><p>On Midsummer Eve, 1865, more than 30 Finnish and Sami immigrants disembarked from a Great Lakes ship to a place called Hancock, Michigan. At the time, Hancock consisted of nothing more than a small cluster of humble buildings, but it was here, on the outskirts of mid-19th-century civilization, that Finnish settlement in Michigan&#39;s Upper Peninsula (UP) took root. Much to the surprise of these new Americans, Midsummer was not a religious holiday marked by feasts in celebration of the season&#39;s prolonged sunlight. Rather, the newcomers were immediately hastened into the bowels of the earth to extract copper in pursuit of the American Dream. In short order, hardworking Finnish immigrants became reputable miners, lumberjacks, farmers, maids, and commercial fishermen. A century and a half later, the UP boasts the largest Finnish population outside of the motherland and sustains the determined spirit the Finns call sisu--an influence that remains palpable in all 15 UP counties.</p><p>The staff of Finlandia University&#39;s Finnish American Heritage Center (FAHC) takes pride in &#34;being Finnish&#34; for a living. The FAHC actively preserves materials to tell the story of Finnish immigrants in the United States. This book offers a small glimpse at the FAHC&#39;s extensive collection while illustrating a spectrum of the experiences of Finns across Michigan&#39;s UP."""The Finns' influence on Upper Michigan's life, history and culture is well documented. Now, it's also well compiled and ready for a place on your bookshelf or coffee table. The Finnish American Heritage Center has recently completed a book in the "Images of America" series through Arcadia Press titled "Finns of Michigan's Upper Peninsula."<br>Though the book includes contributions from some other agencies, it primarily contains images from the FAHC's extensive photo collection. The book illustrates a spectrum of the experiences of Finns across the Upper Peninsula, a region in which many Finnish Americans have roots.<br>In fact, the westernmost five counties of Upper Michigan are the only counties in the United States where Finnish is the predominant ancestry, according to the most recent census records.<br>Regardless of where a person's roots are in the U.P., they're sure to find images in this book that'll surely spark memories of remarkable places, people and events.

Not the tourist's New York-the Statue of Liberty makes a brief appearance and the Empire State Building not at all-but the guts, the underbelly, of this city that never sleeps. With drawings and comics in her signature style, Wertz regales us with streetscapes "Then and Now" and little-known tales, such as the lost history of Kim's Video, the complicated and unresolved business of Ray's Pizza, the vintage trash and horse bones that litter the shore of Brooklyn's Bottle Beach, the ludicrous pinball prohibition, Staten Island's secret abandoned boatyard, and the hair-raising legend of the infamous abortionist of Fifth Avenue, Madame Restell. From bars, bakeries, and bookstores to food carts, street cleaners, and apartments both cramped and grand, <i>Tenements, Towers &amp; Trash</i> is a wild ride in a time machine taxi from the present day city to bygone days of yore.<br><br></p><p><b>Julia Wertz</b> is a professional cartoonist and amateur historian.

The crowded panels evoke the jostle of urban life. Your eye doesn't know where to settle; there's so much to absorb."&#x2015;<b><i>The New York Times<br></i></b><br><br>"Julia Wertz's <i>Tenements, Towers and Trash</i> is nothing short of extraordinary. The meticulously researched histories of the various urban landscapes are fascinating, and Wertz's drawings perfectly capture the visual poetry of the city- the ongoing struggle between past and present, and its unique blend of beauty and ugliness.

The divine voice does not peal from Sinai, there are no narratives carried along by prophetic interpretation nor are oracles declaimed by a prophet. Here Scripture often speaks in the words of human response to God and God's world. The hymns, laments and thanksgivings of Israel, the dirge of Lamentations, the questionings of Qohelet, the love poetry of the Song of Songs, the bold drama of Job and the proverbial wisdom of Israel all offer their textures to this great body of biblical literature. Then too there are the finely crafted stories of Ruth and Esther that narrate the silent providence of God in the course of Israelite and Jewish lives. This third Old Testament volume in InterVarsity Press's celebrated "Black Dictionary" series offers nearly 150 articles covering all the important aspects of Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Ruth and Esther. Over ninety contributors, many of them experts in this literature, have contributed to the <em>Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry Writings.</em> This volume maintains the quality of scholarship that students, scholars and pastors have come to expect from this series. Coverage of each biblical book includes an introduction to the book itself as well as separate articles on its ancient Near Eastern background and its history of interpretation. Additional articles amply explore the literary dimensions of Hebrew poetry and prose, including acrostic, ellipsis, inclusio, intertextuality, parallelism and rhyme. And there are well-rounded treatments of Israelite wisdom and wisdom literature, including wisdom poems, sources and theology. In addition, a wide range of interpretive approaches is canvassed in articles on hermeneutics, feminist interpretation, form criticism, historical criticism, rhetorical criticism and social-scientific approaches. The <em>Dictionary of the Old Testament: Wisdom, Poetry Writings</em> is sure to command shelf space within arm's reach of any student, teacher or preacher working in this portion of biblical literature.

But Scicolone also serves up a profusion of fascinating&nbsp;lesser-known dishes: a creamy polenta lasagna, a port-braised chicken from Portugal, a spiced frittata from Tunisia, and Bandit's Lamb, as well as her own seductive creations, like Cannoli Cheesecake.</p><p>Michele Scicolone is the author of <i>The Italian Vegetable Cookbook,&nbsp;</i><i>The Italian Slow Cooker, <em>The French Slow Cooker</em>, <em>The Sopranos Family Cookbook</em>, a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, and <em>Entertaining with the Sopranos.</em> Her <em>1000 Italian Recipes</em> and <em>A Fresh Taste of Italy</em></i><em> were nominated for James Beard and International Association of Culinary Professionals Awards.</em><p><b>Beef Stew with Tiny Onions and Cinnamon<br></b>&#x2014; GREECE &#x2014;<br>This Greek-style beef stew looks and tastes familiar, but it&#x2019;s just different enough to make it special. Part of the secret to its elusive flavor is a dash of vinegar. I serve the stew with cauliflower and potatoes mashed with olive oil.</p> <p>SERVES 6 TO 8<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 tablespoons olive oil<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3� pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 large onion, chopped<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 pearl onions, trimmed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� cup dry red wine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� cup red wine vinegar<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 28-ounce can tomato puree<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 bay leaf<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� teaspoon ground cinnamon<br><br>Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the beef dry with paper towels. Add the beef in batches, without crowding the pan. Brown it well on all sides, about 15 minutes per batch. With a slotted spoon, transfer it to a large slow cooker and sprinkle with salt and pepper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add the chopped onion to the skillet and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the pearl onions, wine, and vinegar. Bring the liquid to a simmer. Pour the mixture into the slow cooker. Stir in the tomato puree, bay leaf, and cinnamon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or until the beef is very tender. Discard the bay leaf. Serve hot.<br></p> <p><b>Pulled Pork<br></b>&#x2014; PORTUGAL &#x2014;<br>Portuguese fishermen who settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts, brought with them a love for this flavorful stew. The traditional way to make it is in a clay pot called a cacoila, but a slow cooker is the perfect substitute. The shredded meat that emerges is still a favorite at street fairs and in local sandwich shops. Serve it over rice or pile it into crisp rolls and top with hot pickled peppers for a casual party.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>SERVES 8<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tablespoons olive oil<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 pounds boneless pork shoulder roast, rolled and tied<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt and freshly ground pepper<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 large onions, sliced<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� cup red wine vinegar<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tablespoons smoked paprika<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 cup water<br><br>In a large skillet, heat the oil. Pat the pork dry with paper towels and brown it well on all sides, about 20 minutes. Transfer the pork to a large slow cooker and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add the onions and garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring often, until tender and golden, about 10 minutes. Stir in the vinegar and bring it to a simmer. Pour the mixture over the pork. Add the spices, salt and pepper to taste, and water. Cover and cook for 8 to 10 hours, or until the pork is fork-tender.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the pork to a cutting board, but leave the sauce in the slow cooker with the heat on. With two forks, tear the pork into bite-size pieces. Return the meat to the slow cooker to reheat and serve.<br></p> <p><b>Coffee Caramel Flan<br></b>&#x2014; SPAIN &#x2014;<br>With canned sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk in the pantry, you can put this dessert together any time.</p> <p>SERVES 8<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 cup sugar<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;� cup water<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 12-ounce can evaporated milk<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 large eggs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 large egg yolks<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 tablespoons instant espresso powder, dissolved in 1 tablespoon hot water<br></p> <p>Combine the sugar and the water in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved. Simmer the mixture without stirring until it begins to turn brown around the edges, about 10 minutes. Gently swirl the pan until the syrup is evenly caramelized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protecting your hand with an oven mitt, pour the hot syrup into a 6-cup souffl� dish, turning the dish to coat the bottom evenly. Let cool until the caramel is just set.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bowl, whisk together the canned milks. Beat in the eggs, egg yolks, and espresso until blended. Pour the mixture into the souffl� dish.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the dish on a rack in a large slow cooker. Pour hot water to a depth of 1 inch around the dish. Cover and cook on high for 2 to 2� hours, or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully remove the dish from the slow cooker. Let cool slightly, then cover and refrigerate until chilled, several hours or overnight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve, run a knife around the inside of the dish. Invert a serving plate on top and quickly invert the two. Carefully remove the souffl� dish, allowing the caramel to drizzle over the cream. Cut into wedges and serve.<br></p></p><h2>Target Africa: Ideological Neocolonialism in the Twenty-First Century</h2><p><p>Since the end of colonization Africa has struggled with socioeconomic and political problems. This has attracted wealthy donors from western nations, organizations and private foundations who have assumed the role of helper and deliverer. While some donors have good intentions, there are other western "progressive" donors whose gifts to Africa are often attached to their ideology of sexual liberation. These are the ideological neo-colonial masters of the 21st century who aggressively push into Africa their views on contraception, population control, sexualisation of children, feminism, homosexuality and abortion.</p><p>The author, a native of Africa, shows how these donors are masterful at exploiting some of the heaviest burdens and afflictions of Africa such as maternal mortality, unplanned pregnancies, HIV/AIDS pandemic, child marriage and persistent poverty. This exploitation has put many African nations in the vulnerable position of receiving funding tied firmly to ideological solutions that are opposed to the cultural views and values of the people.</p><p>Thus many African nations are put back into the protectorate positions of dependency as new cultural standards conceived in the west are made into core policies in African capitals and the new redefined terms of the west become applied within various African ministries.</p><p>This book reveals a problematic facet of neo-colonialism that is rarely seen or talked about. Drawing from a broad array of well-sourced materials and documents, it tells the story of foreign aid gifts with strings attached, the story of Africa targeted and recolonized by wealthy powerful donors.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>AUTHOR Obianuju "Uju" Ekeocha is a native African woman, living and working in the United Kingdom as a Specialist Biomedical Scientist.

Christopher Stackhouse&#39;s thoughtful book, the first full monograph on the artist, highlights Whitney&#39;s commitment to abstract painting over four decades of consistent practice, bringing together Whitney&#39;s personal and professional narratives to weave a chronological analysis of the work and the artist&#39;s wider cultural contribution. Born in Philadelphia in 1946, Whitney moved to New York in 1968, and under the guidance of Philip Guston he began to experiment with abstraction, drawn to the basic formal qualities of Abstract Expressionism, the pure chroma of the Color Field movement, and the minimalist approach of such artists as Donald Judd. Steadfastly pursuing abstraction at a time when critical interest was focused on figurative art and photography, Whitney has not received the critical recognition due to him until late in his career. This book affirms his outstanding achievement.</p><p><b>Christopher Stackhouse</b> is a freelance critic, poet, lecturer, and curator based in New York.</p><h2>Power Tarot: More Than 100 Spreads That Give Specific Answers to Your Most Important Question</h2><p>Reading the cards has never been easier, even if you've never done a spread before!<br><br>With more than 100 spreads to choose from, <i>Power Tarot</i> offers experienced and novice readers alike innovative and accurate ways to get answers to their most pressing questions on romance, work, finances, health, and spiritual growth. From the single card "Yes/No" draw, to the comprehensive twenty-four card spread of the Double Horoscope, from the traditional Celtic Cross to the Past-Life Spread, you will find spreads to answer particular questions, while others describe more general situations. Writing in plain English, authors Trish MacGregor and Phyllis Vega give you information an the meaning of each card in the tarot deck (no matter which deck you use), both in general and as the card relates to specific issues. There are tips on how to determine the time frame of an event, exciting insights into traditional interpretations, and easy-to-follow diagrams for the position and meaning of the cards in each spread.</p><p>Trish MacGregor, author and professional tarot reader, lives in Boynton Beach, Florida.<b>Chapter 1: What Is Tarot?</b><br><br>The tarot has entered an unprecedented boom period, with more than three hundred decks now on the market. Their motifs range from angels to legends, the Middle Ages to the millennium.<br><br>The lure of a particular deck lies as much in the artwork as it does in how the deck feels when you handle it. Favorite decks usually speak to something private and sacred within you; they are like old friends you haven't visited for a long time. They <i>feel</i> right.<br><br>If you're just beginning your work with the tarot, the best deck you can use is either the Rider Waite or any Waite-Smith clone. The latter includes: Universal Waite, Albano Waite, Golden Rider, Morgan Greer, Hanson Roberts, Tarot of the Cloisters, Robin Wood, and The Aquarian Tarot.<br><br>Learn the textbook definitions of the seventy-eight cards, practice the traditional spreads, read for yourself, your family, your friends, whoever will sit still long enough. Practice until the definitions become as familiar to you as your name. And then read for strangers.<br><br>The first time you read for someone you don't know, all kinds of emotions will wash through you: exhilaration, nervousness, triumph, uncertainty. You'll quickly discover which cards demand more of your attention, which ones you know by heart, which ones pertain most strongly to a particular individual. Whether you stumble through the reading or glide through it smoothly, you'll have a much clearer sense of the tarot's voice -- and the voice of the deck you're using.<br><br>As you work with the tarot, you'll find that some cards recur; no matter how you shuffle the deck or what spread you use, the same cards keep coming up. These usually depict patterns in your life or in the life of the person for whom you're reading. They assume a personal meaning that may not be in line with the textbook definition. If you're relentless, you'll eventually have highly personal definitions for all of the seventy-eight cards. And that's what the tarot is really about: <i>What does this card mean to me?</i><br><br>There are certain cards you will love and welcome; there are others you will detest and dread. The Tower stands out as an excellent example.<br><br>Its image from deck to deck doesn't vary much. The Tower stands tall against a darkened, ugly sky that looms with menace. Lightning strikes its ancient walls, objects or people or both tumble from its windows, the water below it seems to bubble and writhe like a primal sea. Things are not in good shape.<br><br>In the beginning, this card will send chills up your spine, you'll be expecting the absolute worst: a pink slip in the mail, a legal judgment that isn't in your favor, car problems, electrical problems, problems, problems, problems.<br><br>But as you work with the Tower, you'll realize that it's also about breaking old routines and patterns that limit who and what you are. The card is the equivalent of the planet Uranus in astrology in that it symbolizes the breaking apart of structures that tend to restrict you. The Tower puts you on notice that change is required. If you don't change voluntarily, then change will be imposed on you by some external force.<br><br>As with any language, your grasp of the tarot will change, evolve, and deepen the more you use it.<br><br><i><b>The Arcanas</b></i><br><br>The typical Tarot deck has seventy-eight cards that are divided into the major arcana (22) and the minor arcana (56). Think of the majors as archetypal events, <i>big</i> issues that concern character and destiny. Minors are concerned with circumstances and behavior and illustrate how the energy of the majors manifests in your daily life.<br><br>The majors, numbered from zero to twenty-one, are ports in a journey that begins with the wildly innocent enthusiasm of the Fool and ends with the sophistication and knowledge of the World. They are the most powerful cards in the deck. Sometimes, the majors tell you all you need to know to understand the dynamics in a person's life.<br><br>The minors are divided into four suits: wands, cups, swords, and pentacles. They correspond to the four elements, the four personality types, the four seasons. The suits are the DNA of the minor arcana, the building blocks.<br><br>Each suit is numbered from one through ten and has four court cards. The pips, or numbered cards, represent the patterns which the archetypes weave in our lives; the court cards usually represent people or behavior patterns. In some decks, you'll find the court cards called something else -- the page and knight, for instance, are a prince and princess. But if you're just beginning with the tarot, it's easiest to work with decks that have traditional names for the court cards.<br><br>The mundane and esoteric meanings for the cards will vary, depending on which decks you use and which books you read. Once you become familiar with the cards, you'll supplement and expand the meanings from your own experience. Our meanings began with the traditional definitions, then grew and expanded through trial and error. So will yours.<br><br><i><b>The Tarot Journal</b></i><br><br>In the beginning, a journal can be an invaluable aid. It doesn't have to be anything complicated; a notebook or a file in your computer will do. Since you'll be reading mostly for yourself at first, jot down the date, your question, the cards you pulled, and your interpretation. Check back periodically to see how accurate the reading was.<br><br>There's nothing like success to bolster confidence. You may be surprised to discover how often you're right on target. The best readings are those in which your intuition speaks through the cards.<br><br>Sometimes, a journal points out a flawed interpretation of just one or two cards in a given reading. In the summer of 1994, for example, a friend of ours, Eva, was in the process of separating from her husband. She asked us to do a reading on how the divorce would go.<br><br>We did the five-card Direction Spread for her (included in the section of five-card spreads) and in the fourth position -- who or what will help -- drew the king of swords. Eva had recently spoken to a male attorney about possible representation and we interpreted the king to be the attorney.<br><br>But several months down the road, it was obvious that the king was Eva's husband. They had managed to work out mutually acceptable terms for the divorce and never needed an attorney. Her husband, in fact, didn't want an attorney involved any more than she did and ended up buying a townhouse for her and their daughter. Eva now pays her mortgage directly to him.<br><br>Given the information we had to work with, our interpretation wasn't wrong. The king of swords is typically a male over forty who communicates without emotion. He might be a businessman, a surgeon, a lawyer. He cuts to the heart of the matter. Eva's husband is a successful businessman in his sixties who communicated in a straightforward manner about what he could live with in a divorce agreement. It simply seemed inconceivable to her at the time that her husband would be of any help at all.<br><br>After a certain point, the journal may become cumbersome or your entries too erratic to be of much help. So set the journal aside. There aren't any rules. You don't have to keep a journal to read tarot cards. It's simply a tool and once you outgrow your use for it, don't keep doing it because you feel you have to. Above all, tarot should be fun, thrilling, liberating, empowering.<br><br><i><b>Spreads</b></i><br><br>The spreads in this book can be used by beginners, pros, and everyone in between. If you're just starting out, the shorter spreads are easiest. In fact, the best way to learn the definitions of the cards is to pull a card a day, jot the card and definition in your journal, and at the end of the day note how this energy manifested.<br><br>If you've reached the point where you're reading for family and friends, you'll want to practice with more complex spreads. We recommend the spreads with five to seven cards, which can be adapted for just about any question.<br><br>The Ladle Spread, for instance, packs a lot of information into just six cards. It provides an overview of the question, pinpoints what is hidden, what is emerging, what is visible, what you "scoop out," or obtain; and explains the key element in the issue. You can lay out another six cards for additional information, for a total of twelve cards.<br><br>One of our clients wanted to know how his relationship with his current girlfriend was going to work out. The Ladle Spread told a rather accurate story.<br><br>The Lovers in the overview position made it clear he was going to have to make a choice about this relationship. The eight of cups appeared in the hidden position -- that he would soon walk away from the relationship because for him, it was finished. The six of swords in the third position indicated that, mentally, he had already moved away from this relationship toward something else that was unknown, but less tumultuous.<br><br>In the fourth position, what is visible, he drew the ace of swords. This indicated that he had already met someone else who interested him. Sure enough, the queen of cups, an older nurturing woman, turned up in the fifth position. The last card was the ace of wands, indicating that he would shortly begin a new job.<br><br>He wanted additional information about the queen of cups, so he drew three more cards for the fifth position: the four of swords, the five of swords, and the three of wands. This suggested that the new woman was currently in a respite period, perhaps recuperating from surgery or illness, or simply reevaluating what she wanted out of her life. The five of swords made it likely that she had recently won some dispute and, because of it, would soon be working in partnership with other people (three of wands).<br><br>The young man said it was all true. The relationship with this new woman had already begun, he had applied for a new job, and now he was prepared to walk away from his old girlfriend. This was a reading in which it wasn't necessary to draw supplementary cards for all six positions; the queen of cups was the woman about whom he wanted more information.<br><br>Most questions seem to fall into several broad categories: romance, work/career, finances, health, and spiritual matters. The spreads in this book address specifics within each of these categories.<br><br>A question about love, for instance, might be answered more thoroughly by the ten-card Ongoing Relationship Spread than by the traditional Celtic Cross. If you're inquiring about your spiritual progress, the five-card Belief Spread is a good place to start.<br><br><i><b>When Is It Going to Happen?</b></i><br><br>The trickiest part of tarot has to do with timing. Unlike astrology and numerology, the tarot doesn't lend itself to exact timing. This is actually one of the reasons we prefer tarot to other disciplines. We believe that the point of power is in the present and that the future is plastic and open-ended and can be changed in any moment.<br><br>Having said this, one of the questions we hear most from people is: When will a particular event happen? Everyone seems to want to know when. When will I meet the love of my life? When will that job promotion come through? When will I get out of debt, engaged, married, pregnant, divorced?<br><br>The best way to obtain a general time frame is to use one of the spreads that contains a built-in timing device. Some spreads that fall into this category are: six-card Timing, seven-card Pyramid, and seven-card Weekly. Before you begin the reading, state the time frame: X number of days, weeks, or months.<br><br>Other spreads have a timing factor built into them through a near-future position in the layout. In the Celtic Cross, this is the sixth position; you can decide before the reading what period of time it covers.<br><br>One quick method of answering the timing question is to pull cards until you reach an ace. Before you pull the cards, decide whether they represent days, weeks, months, or years. Then count the number of cards you turned over before you got to the ace.<br><br>The classic, but more cumbersome method, is to key the cards to the seasons of the year. This can be done in several ways. Our favorite is to remove the major arcana from the deck and to work with the court and pip cards. Pick one card from this deck of fifty-six. This becomes your timing card.<br><br>The key to this system is: wands = spring; cups = summer; pentacles = autumn; swords = winter. An ace then represents the first week of the season, a two is the second week of the season, and so on, through the queen as the thirteenth week of the season. Kings represent the transition from one season to the next.<br><br>Another timing method is to use the numbers on the cards as a timing device. With the major arcana, remove The Fool from the deck. The probable timing will run from one to twenty-two days, weeks, or months. With the pip cards you can go up to ten months; by adding the court cards, the time is extended to fourteen months. The meanings of the cards don't come into play; only the numbers are important.<br><br>Future changes depend on the questioner's beliefs, thoughts, feelings, choices, and decisions. When pressed for an exact date we'll provide answers using one or more of the methods discussed in this section. But any timing prediction should be prefaced with an explanation that a time frame can be changed through intent and desire.<br><br><i><b>What If a Reading Doesn't Make Sense?</b></i><br><br>It happens. The cards are in front of you, you know what they mean, but when you try to put them together they don't make sense. The best thing you can do it simply pick up the cards and try another spread. If this doesn't work, then try a spread using just the major arcana.<br><br>If the cards still seem confused, tell the person you're reading for that the cards don't seem to want to address that particular question or issue at the moment and suggest that you move on to something else. It's a bad idea to tell the person you can't read for them right now; the individual might interpret it to mean you have foreseen his or her imminent demise.<br><br><i><b>Should I Read Reversed Cards?</b></i><br><br>Reversed cards refer to cards that are upside down. Some readers feel the tarot is incomplete unless you read reversed cards, but you'll find pros and cons on this point. Other readers think there are already enough negative cards to deal with, so why add seventy-eight more? Ultimately, you'll have to decide for yourself if you should read them reversed.<br><br>At first, though, for the sake of simplicity, its probably a good idea to stick to the upright meanings for the deck. After all, it's much easier to learn seventy-eight definitions than a hundred and fifty-six definitions.<br><br>We tend to read reversed cards only if they fall out of the deck that way, which is why you won't find the meanings for reversed positions in this book. The only other instance in which we use reversed cards is to answer yes/no questions.<br><br>Quite often an individual will want a simple yay or nay about something. We then shuffle a deck so there are reversed cards and deal out five. If the majority are upright, the answer is yes; vice versa would mean a resounding no.<br><br>If you use one of the round decks -- Motherpeace or Tarot of the Cloisters -- reversed meanings become something of a moot issue. With round decks, there are no definite ups or downs to the cards.<br><br><i><b>Deck Care and Preparation Rituals</b></i><br><br>When you first get your tarot deck, you should shuffle and mix the cards until you feel they're ready to use. The idea is to infuse them with your particular energy to create a special link between you and the deck. Some readers suggest you sleep with the...</p><h2>Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon Piano, Vocal and Guitar Chords</h2><p>(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Artist Songbook).

Even when such decisions claim to be guided by objective knowledge, they are made and implemented through political institutions and relationships&#x2014;and all the competing interests and power struggles that this implies. Michael M�ndez tells a timely story of people, place, and power in the context of climate change and inequality. He explores the perspectives and influence low-income people of color bring to their advocacy work on climate change. In California, activist groups have galvanized behind issues such as air pollution, poverty alleviation, and green jobs to advance equitable climate solutions at the local, state, and global levels. Arguing that environmental protection and improving public health are inextricably linked, Mendez contends that we must incorporate local knowledge, culture, and history into policymaking to fully address the global complexities of climate change and the real threats facing our local communities.</p></p><p><b>Michael M�ndez</b> is assistant professor of environmental planning and policy at the University of California, Irvine. He previously served in California as a senior consultant, lobbyist, and gubernatorial appointee during the passage of the state&#x2019;s internationally acclaimed climate change legislation."Mendez's argument is both urgent and fascinating: at the scale of the places where most people live, global warming can only be addressed as part of a broader public-health crisis."&#x2014;Mike Davis, author of <i>Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster</i><br><br> "A crucial addition to the climate change literature.

Bullard, author of&nbsp; <i>The Wrong Complexion for Protection: How the Government Response to Disaster Endangers African American Communities</i><br><br> "This excellent richly-researched book connects evidence, public health, and politics to argue lucidly for equity-oriented approaches linking embodiment, environmental justice, and climate change."&#x2014;Nancy Krieger, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health<br><br> "Focusing on environmental justice, Mendez vividly illustrates the need to link environmental protection with poverty and health. In the process, local climate action is shown to be critical to a multi-level approach. I highly recommended this book."&#x2014;Frank Fischer, author of <i>Climate Crisis and the Democratic Prospect</i><br><br> "A first-rate &#x2013; and first-hand &#x2013; account of how environmental justice activists shifted climate policy in California, this is a must-read for understanding how grassroots activism can shift science, policy, and politics."&#x2014;Manuel Pastor, author of&nbsp;<i>State of Resistance:&nbsp;What California&#x2019;s Dizzying Descent and Remarkable Resurgence Mean for America&#x2019;s Future</i><br><br> "Mendez&#x2019;s refreshing approach engages the diverse embodied perspectives of a broad range of activists, the multiscale reality of environmental injustice, and the real work of making policy across difference.

My 34-year-old sister-in-law, Lisa, had died recently, and I'd gone to Maryland to help pack up her things. On the drive home to Hoboken, New Jersey, my arms went numb. I became dizzy and short of breath, my vision blurred, and my muscles were shaky and weak. I was sure I was having a heart attack. When I showed up at the hospital and the ER doctors diagnosed me with an anxiety attack, I argued with them. How could I be having an anxiety attack? I'm a yoga teacher. When Lisa was 30 years old, she was diagnosed with asbestos-induced lung cancer. She was my oldest brother's wife, and even more significant than our closeness was that she was like me. This marked the first time someone I loved who was also my own age became seriously ill. We were both young, active professional women at the beginning of our careers, eagerly stepping into adulthood. She was a step or two ahead of me, with a husband and a baby, but otherwise her circumstances could have been mine. Like Lisa, I had an abundance of spirit and ambition-and, I assumed, plenty of time to grow into a successful life. These realizations began as small thoughts when she was diagnosed, bouncing around inside me for all the years of her illness. In boxing up Lisa's things-her well-worn cowboy boots, her Levi's jean jacket, her Mickey Mouse sweatshirt-a major truth began taking root inside me: We are not really in control of our life. I had been no stranger to family illness. My father was in the hospital regularly throughout my life with heart disease, cancers, and kidney disease. But as a family, we focused our attention on doctor appointments and home care. We never talked about how we felt or how his illness was affecting us inside. If I cried about my father, it was alone in my room. Initially, I dealt with Lisa's illness and death the same way: muscling through and pushing away my emotions. But my anxiety attack cracked my protective armor and revealed layers of vulnerability I had never experienced before. Suddenly, I could no longer muscle my way through anything. I felt afraid most of the time, and because I was in a constant state of anxiety, I began to see the world through a lens of fear. I was scared to ride the subway, scared to fly in a plane. Daily challenges that I used to conquer enthusiastically now made me shaky. I felt as if I were forever running away from danger. When a major event, transition, or unexpected incident triggers a big shift in perspective, feelings we have buried for years often rise up, seemingly out of nowhere. I now know that my panic attack was simply my first acute response to fears that I'd been living with my whole life but that only began to rise to the surface as I watched my sister-in-law's struggle. Fear about all the ways I was not enough: not strong enough to overcome illness, not talented enough to be successful in my job, not worthy enough to be loved. I had turned to yoga in the past to get through difficult life events, but the fear I experienced around Lisa's death was different. And it launched the beginning of my deepest practice.<br><br><b>MY EARLY YOGA</b><br><br>The first time I ever did yoga or meditation I was 9 years old. My mother had my brothers and me learn Transcendental Meditation, and she took me with her to yoga classes at the gym. She considered all of this "family therapy." I was the only one in the family who enjoyed it, but I was passionate about most things. I was a go-getter from the get-go. I became president of every club I joined. I was a dedicated athlete. Over time, I grew into a "you-can- do-it" fitness instructor and an energetic young executive. When Lisa became ill, I had (and taught) a yoga practice that was physical and athletic, like me. I'd built my entire identity around being able to achieve things. I loved how powerful my body felt when I practiced yoga. I loved the sensations of openness and expansiveness when challenging my physical boundaries. I did headstands so I could feel mighty and successful and strong. In the wake of Lisa's death, I suffered from both anxiety and exhaustion. As my health faltered, I realized that the yoga practice I had created to make myself feel solid and secure was not the type of practice I needed to become a more active participant in my own well-being. It seems like someone who is the president of everything would be plenty active already, right? But I discovered that the many things I was actively pursuing all the time often did not support my health. I spent a lot of time doing and very little time being.<br><br><b>WHAT IS WELL-BEING?</b><br><br>Ithink of well-being as the ability to live in a state of contentment. Contentment is a bit different from simply being happy. We usually think of happiness as dependent on a set of circumstances. Contentment, on the other hand, is not dependent on anything. It's a sense of not needing or wanting things to be different in order to feel "okay." When we cultivate a sense of well-being, we are developing a relationship with ourselves that provides exactly the type of strength and security I thought I would find in mastering headstands. Well-being is the ability to stay grounded, relaxed, and open to whatever your circumstances are. It's the freedom to be present with whatever is going on inside or outside of you. It's no longer suffering from the exhaustion or disappointment of trying to make everything "just right." Spiritual teachers refer to this condition as the state of equanimity-being open to things just the way they are. Well-being is available to anyone at any time. But, like headstands, it takes practice.<br><br><b>BE</b> <b>HERE, DO LESS</b><br><br>You don't need to travel to India to find contentment. You don't need to push yourself to "be better" or "do more" to have a sense of well-being. In fact, I invite my students to "be here" and "do less." We cultivate well-being by relaxing into the life that we have right now. The notion that we can live better by striving less may seem like a radical concept in this age of relentless Internet searches and the endless barrage of information that's thrust toward us every day. It's certainly not the type of solution we're used to. Fostering a sense of well-being does not require anything especially difficult. But it does require showing up and spending time with ourselves in a way we may not be accustomed to.<br><br><b>LET'S</b> <b>PAUSE FOR A MOMENT</b><br><br>Showing up starts with a simple action: We pause. Pausing is an activity that's accomplished exactly the way you'd think-we just stop for a bit. It's a small break that we take, on purpose, to gather ourselves. When we pause, we take a moment to be with ourselves, right here, right now, in whatever state we're in. We don't have to do anything. We don't have to feel any particular way. Pausing gives us extra room to take things in. It allows us time to listen to ourselves before responding or reacting. We pause so we can pay attention to ourselves, to others, and to the world around us in a more open and compassionate way. It's one of the main tools we use to release tension in our bodies and in our minds. It's one of the most valuable skills we can develop to change habits that do not serve us. We are going to pause a lot together through this journey. I consider it my go-to tool. Pausing is not only a useful skill for day-today living, but, as we'll discover, it's also an always-available activity that we can use to transform our life.<br><br><b>WELCOME YOURSELF</b><br><br>Every time I practice, the first thing I do is pause and welcome myself. Imagine for a moment what it's like to show up somewhere and feel welcome- really, really welcome. Imagine that moment when you truly sense how delighted someone is that you've arrived. When we feel welcomed, we show up more. There is no more powerful message we can send to ourselves than greeting ourselves with open arms.<br><br><b>Welcome</b><br><br><b>In whatever way you're showing up here . . .</b> wherever you may have been . . . gather your whole self up and let yourself know you're welcome here. Whether you're showing up with expectations . . . or with fears . . . whether you're showing up in joy . . . or in sorrow . . . take a moment to greet yourself exactly as you are right now. Gather yourself up and welcome all of you: your mind, your body, your breath. Sit for a moment and welcome yourself along with each breath as it fills you. Welcome your breath into your body. Welcome your mind onto your breath. Welcome your body into the room. Your breath is always welcoming you. Meet your breath with your body. Greet your breath with your body. Take a moment to be with your breath. Take a moment to be with yourself. When we feel welcomed, we show up more.<br><br><b>Practices for Welcoming Ourselves</b><br><br>We are learning to welcome our breath into our body. We are learning to welcome our mind onto our breath. We are learning to create a safe space for ourselves, so we can show up more.<br><br><b>CONTEMPLATION</b><br><br>Imagine being greeted by someone who would welcome you with great warmth. This could be a friend, family member, mentor, a spiritual teacher, or even a pet-anyone who you can imagine welcoming you wholeheartedly. If you had a video of this reception, what do you look like? What would your posture be like? What would the expression on your face be as you were greeted? What does it feel like to be you, when you feel safe and welcomed?<br><br><b>MEDITATION EXPERIENCE: ELEVATOR TO A WELCOMING ARRIVAL</b><br><br>This simple technique uses visualization to help you feel more welcomed and safe. .Sit in a comfortable position on the ground or in a chair. Close your eyes, if you wish. Take a few long exhales. Notice where your body meets support. .Envision your body as a three-story building. Now imagine an elevator inside this building. The third floor is from your crown to your shoulders. The second floor is from your shoulders to your belly. The first floor is from your belly to where your seat meets support. .Now imagine the elevator lowering down through the center of you one flight at a time. .Begin at the crown of your head. .Exhale: Envision the elevator lowering from crown to shoulders. Inhale: Imagine the doors of the elevator opening, fresh air and light coming in. .Exhale: Let your weight drain down another flight, from shoulders to belly. Feel your inhale freshen you. .Exhale: Continue to the ground floor. Allow your body weight to lower completely into your seat and legs. The elevator doors open on your inhale, filling you with reviving breath. .Repeat this lowering process one to three more times. .On your last elevator exhale, allow yourself to land completely on the ground. And when the elevator doors open, imagine a dear one is there to greet you sweetly. .Let this imagery fade and place one hand on your heart and one on your belly. Feel your breath under your hands. Stay with the feeling of your breath in your hands for a moment. Welcome your breath with your hands. Welcome your breath into your body. Welcome your mind onto your breath, into your body. Welcome yourself here, now, as you are. .Sit for a few minutes longer, feeling yourself grounded, as you continually welcome your breath and yourself. .To close, welcome yourself again into your seat, on the ground. Set an intention to stay with yourself as you transition out of the meditation. You will repeatedly be pulled away from your breath by thoughts, sensations, or sounds. This is not a problem but a chance to welcome yourself back, to return to greet your breath, over and over again, into the moment.<br><br><b>YOGA EXPERIENCE: HERO POSE</b><br><br><b>PROPS:</b> Two yoga blocks stacked. If needed, stack three blocks or sit on a chair and begin with the second bulleted step. .Kneel, with your seat resting on your stacked blocks. Your inner thighs a few inches apart. The tops of your feet face-down along the sides of your block. .With your hands, draw the muscular part of your back thighs out to the sides to more easily feel your sit bones on the support. .Imagine the way an elevator lowers, one flight at a time, and gently lengthen your next three exhales as the elevator lowers from your head down to your shoulders, from your shoulders down to belly, and from your belly down to your seat and legs. .Sit for 5 to 10 breaths, as you allow your blocks to hold you up completely. .For the last few breaths, place your hands on your belly; feel your breath move under your hands. Welcome your breath into your hands. Welcome yourself onto the ground. .Mindfully transition out of the pose when you are ready. When you allow the ground to hold you, you can release resistance, you can release the tension that would limit the flow of the breath. When you feel more welcomed on the ground, your breath is more welcome in you.<br><br><b>RESTORATIVE YOGA EXPERIENCE: CONSTRUCTIVE REST</b><br><br><b>PROPS:</b> Two long rectangle-folded blankets, stacked.<br><br><b>SET UP</b><br><br>Lie down on your back, knees bent, feet on the floor, arms resting alongside your body. Bring your feet a few inches from your seat and a little wider apart than your hips. Let your knees fall together to hold each other up. .Place your stack of blankets over your knees with the long ends draping down the sides of your legs. This will help you release all muscular effort in your legs. .As you explore being in your yoga poses and restoratives, feel free to readjust with any micro movements that help you feel more comfortable, grounded, and at ease.</p><h2>The Mezze Cookbook: Sharing Plates from the Middle East</h2><p><p><b>A vibrant collection of exciting, exotic, and sharing-plate recipes from across the Middle East</b></p><p>More than 135 home-cooking recipes in this book explore the regional diversity of Middle Eastern sharing dishes, from Lebanon and Iran to Turkey and Syria.

Yet as familiar as it is, as James Holland makes clear in his definitive history, many parts of the OVERLORD campaign, as it was known, are still shrouded in myth and assumed knowledge. <p> Drawing freshly on widespread archives and on the testimonies of eye-witnesses, Holland relates the extraordinary planning that made Allied victory in France possible; indeed, the story of how hundreds of thousands of men, and mountains of materiel, were transported across the English Channel, is as dramatic a human achievement as any battlefield exploit. The brutal landings on the five beaches and subsequent battles across the plains and through the lanes and hedgerows of Normandy&#x2015;a campaign that, in terms of daily casualties, was worse than any in World War I&#x2015;come vividly to life in conferences where the strategic decisions of Eisenhower, Rommel, Montgomery, and other commanders were made, and through the memories of paratrooper Lieutenant Dick Winters of Easy Company, British corporal and tanker Reg Spittles, Thunderbolt pilot Archie Maltbie, German ordnance officer Hans Heinze, French resistance leader Robert Leblanc, and many others. </p><p> For both sides, the challenges were enormous. The Allies confronted a disciplined German army stretched to its limit, which nonetheless caused tactics to be adjusted on the fly. Ultimately ingenuity, determination, and immense materiel strength&#x2015;delivered with operational brilliance&#x2015;made the difference. A stirring narrative by a pre-eminent historian, <i>Normandy &#x2018;44</i> offers important new perspective on one of history&#x2019;s most dramatic military engagements and is an invaluable addition to the literature of war.</p></p><p><b>James Holland</b> is the author of <i>Big Week</i>, <i>The Rise of Germany</i> and <i>The Allies Strike Back</i> in the War in the West trilogy, as well as <i>Fortress Malta</i>, <i>Dam Busters</i>, and <i>The Battle of Britain</i>. Holland regularly appears on television and radio and has written and presented the BAFTA shortlisted documentaries <i>Battle of Britain</i> and <i>Dam Busters</i> for the BBC, among others. A fellow of the Royal Historical Society, he has his own collection at the Imperial War Museum.<b>Praise for <i>Normandy &#x2018;44</i>:</b><p><b>An Amazon Best Book of the Month (History)</b><br><b>An Amazon Best History Book of the Year (So Far)</b></p><p>&#x201c;While the invasion&#x2019;s first wave consumes half the book&#x2019;s ammunition, Mr. Holland holds plenty in reserve for the Allied crawl through hedgerow country, the battle with Hitler&#x2019;s panzers at Caen, the brilliant breakout of Operation Cobra seven weeks after D-Day, and the corpse-strewn German retreat through the Falaise Gap . . . Detail and scope are the twin strengths of <i>Normandy &#x2019;44</i> . . . Mr. Holland effectively balances human drama with the science of war as the Allies knew it.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Jonathan W. Jordan, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;A superb account of the invasions that deserves immense praise . . .

This may sound like a story you have heard and seen before, but this version&#x2015;even though the outcome is familiar&#x2015;contains an ingredient too infrequently found in history books: it is exciting . . .

Personal narratives from both Allied and German officers and air and ground troops, along with technical descriptions of weapons manufacture and use, provide an absorbing perspective on one of the most significant events in modern military history.

A skillful writer, Holland delivers the occasional jolt, such as a mild rehabilitation of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.

It was December 12, 1998, and Ty Inc. was three weeks away from closing out a year of sales that would break nearly every record in the annals of the toy industry. Andi Van Guilder was seated in the back with the relatives she&#x2019;d hired to answer the phones that hadn&#x2019;t stopped ringing with orders for Beanie Babies in close to three years. She thought about it. In 1993, she&#x2019;d made less than $30,000 lugging trunks of porcelain figurines and collector plates to stores in two states. In 1998, selling Beanie Babies to independently owned toy and gift shops in Chicago&#x2019;s northern suburbs had paid her more than $800,000 in commissions. She was thirty years old. Life was perfect.</p><p>The applause died down. Ty made the announcement he&#x2019;d been planning for weeks: he would be giving all his employees Christmas bonuses equal to their annual salaries.</p><p>Pandemonium ensued. &#x201c;Ty was their God,&#x201d; Faith McGowan, Ty&#x2019;s then girlfriend, remembers. He basked in the adulation of the workers who, in the span of three years, had helped make him the richest man in the American toy industry. His annual sales for 1998 had surpassed $1.4 billion&#x2014;virtually all of it coming from the $2.50 wholesale price on beanbag animals that frenzied speculators had turned into a craze that was the twentieth-century American version of the tulip bubble in 1630s Holland.</p><p>Ty had created the toys in 1993 in the hope that they would be popular among children, but they had become so much more than that; and they had also become so much less than that because most collectors, aware of the soaring values for the rarest styles, wouldn&#x2019;t let their children anywhere near them. Humorist Dave Barry explained the mania in a 1998 column: &#x201c;Beanie Babies were originally intended as fun playthings for children, but as the old saying goes, &#x2018;Whenever you have something intended as innocent fun for children, you can count on adults to turn it into an obsessive, grotesquely over-commercialized &#x201c;hobby&#x201d; with the same whimsy content as the Bataan Death March.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The first buyers had been children with allowances. Then their moms had started collecting. By the time of the 1998 Ty Christmas party, Van Guilder remembers, it was mostly &#x201c;creepy, belligerent men&#x201d; she saw lined up when she dropped in to check on retailers. The little animals with names like Seaweed the Otter and Gigi the Poodle had become, as Van Guilder puts it, &#x201c;something really cute that just brought out the worst in people.&#x201d;</p><p>The &#x201c;worst in people&#x201d; was inspired by a popular belief that Beanie Babies were a long-term investment. A self-published author sold more than three million copies of a book that touted ten-year predictions for their values. The magazine <i>Mary Beth&#x2019;s Beanie World</i>, started by a self-described soccer mom, reached one million copies in paid monthly circulation. In it, a full-page, full-color ad for Smart Heart tag protectors led with this headline: &#x201c;How Do You Protect an Investment That Increases by 8,400%?&#x201d; The answer was to buy hard-shell lockets in which to encase the animals&#x2019; heart-shaped paper tags that read &#x201c;Safety Precaution: Please remove all swing tags before giving this item to a child.&#x201d; More than any other consumer good in history, Beanie Babies were carried to the height of success by a collective dream that their values would always rise.</p><p>Warner&#x2019;s announcement of bonuses wasn&#x2019;t his only gift to his employees at the Christmas party. He also presented them with #1 Bear, a signed and numbered red Beanie Baby with the number 1 stitched onto the chest. The inside of the hangtag explained that only 253 of the bears had been produced. It also listed the company&#x2019;s achievements for the year: more than $3 billion in retail sales, number one in the gift category, number one in collectibles, and number one in cash register area sales. </p><p>The workers inspected the bears and cheered some more. No doubt some were moved by sentiment, but they also knew that the bear could be listed on eBay, where Beanie Babies comprised 10 percent of all sales. On eBay, Beanie Babies sold for an average of $30&#x2014;six times the price they had originally retailed for. Within a few weeks, #1 Bears would be selling for $5,000 or more apiece.</p><p>Not everyone at the luncheon was so thrilled. Faith McGowan sat quietly. In late 1993, Warner had shown her and her two daughters from her previous marriage who lived with them the first prototype for Legs the Frog. Since then, the animals had been the sole focus of their time together. Even as sales exploded, Ty personally designed every piece the company put out, and that meant spending several months each year at the factories in Asia. The frantic pace of their life together was exhausting, and Ty, a throwback to an entrepreneurial archetype that no longer exists, wasn&#x2019;t slowing down. Today, most rags-to-megariches stories involve hot technology, venture capital, and high-profile initial public offerings. Ty skipped all of that, marketing his own products based on his own ideas and the feedback of everyone around him without ever hiring a marketing consultant or assembling a focus group. He&#x2019;d been the business&#x2019;s only shareholder since he&#x2019;d started it in his condo in 1983, and when the investment bankers came peddling nine- and then ten-figure deals, Warner declined the dinner invitations. &#x201c;Most guys would at least have the decency to jerk you around,&#x201d; remembers one banker. &#x201c;He wouldn&#x2019;t even talk to you.&#x201d;</p><p>McGowan worried that she was losing him. He&#x2019;d told her they would get married, and he&#x2019;d even shown her father the ring he&#x2019;d gotten her. But that had been more than a year ago, and there was no sign of a wedding on the horizon. She was terrified about what would happen if their life together came to an end. A few weeks after the party, Ty informed her that his pretax income for the year had come in at $700 million&#x2014;more than Mattel&#x2019;s and Hasbro&#x2019;s earnings combined. Over in England, Ty&#x2019;s ex-girlfriend Patricia Roche had become rich running the company&#x2019;s distribution there. Faith was apprehensive about Ty&#x2019;s continuing relationship with Roche. More pressingly, Faith was worried that, for all the money Ty had made, she had no assets in her own name. &#x201c;If Ty changed the locks on the Oak Brook house while the girls were at school or I was at work, I had nothing,&#x201d; Faith remembered in an unpublished memoir. &#x201c;No house. No money in the bank. No employee severance. Not even a credit card.&#x201d;</p><p>After the party was over, McGowan prepared for the worst. Ty had presented her with the first #1 Bear&#x2014;1 of 253&#x2014;and she quickly sold it to a local collectibles dealer for ten thousand dollars and a promise not to tell anyone where he&#x2019;d gotten it. She used the money to seed an emergency fund in case her five-year relationship with a man who was now a billionaire imploded. </p><p>Her decision to sell was well timed. That Christmas party happened to mark the absolute height of the Beanie craze, and the beginning of its spectacularly rapid decline. The new millennium was approaching, and the bubble was about to burst. </p><p>_______</p><p>I was in middle school when the Beanies hit and I remember a couple I had. But mostly I remember the Beanie Baby dealers who sprouted at Cape Cod&#x2019;s Dick &amp; Ellie&#x2019;s flea market, which my mother and I visited every weekend. I remember the adults wearing fanny packs and visors, eagerly discussing the &#x201c;secondary market&#x201d; fluctuations driving up the prices of pieces they&#x2019;d paid $5 for a few weeks earlier. The Beanie sellers had the busiest booths and, for a couple of years, it really did look like the dealers sticking with Shaker furniture and oil paintings were as out of touch as Warren Buffett seemed to be when he eschewed Internet stocks in favor of acquiring Dairy Queen in late 1997. </p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t thought about Beanie Babies at all in at least ten years until, on a wintry day in 2010, I stopped at Kimballs, an auction house down the road from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I was a year away from graduating into the worst job market in a generation, and the fallout from the recent speculative mania in real estate was never far from anyone&#x2019;s mind. </p><p>At Kimballs, I was given a reminder of the aftermath of a smaller speculative mania: three large Rubbermaid containers on a table in the back of the room holding at least five hundred Beanie Babies, all with plastic lockets protecting their hangtags. Some were preserved individually in Lucite containers. There was another large box of magazines and price guides with names like <i>Beanies &amp; More</i>,<i> Beanie Collector</i>,<i> Beans! Magazine</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Beanie Mania.</i> Then there were spreadsheets and checklists&#x2014;how many of each Beanie Baby the collector/speculator had, which ones she was missing, how much was paid, and estimates of current value (as of 1998 or 1999). More interesting than the Beanies themselves was the manifest conviction of whoever had assembled the collection that it would one day be of great value. Everything on display was perfectly preserved and, as we found out when the auction started at 6:00 p.m., almost worthless. The entire lot sold for less than a hundred dollars&#x2014;probably well below 2 percent of its value at the height of the Beanie Babies market, which, not coincidentally, was also the height of the Internet stock bubble. </p><p>That the speculative episode in Beanie Babies took place in tandem with the Internet bubble suggests that the cultural forces that were alchemizing Internet stocks had the same effect on Beanie Babies. They rose in an era of unreality defined by magical thinking; as economist Dr. Robert Shiller writes in <i>Irrational Exuberance</i>: &#x201c;Speculative market expansions have often been associated with popular perceptions that the future is brighter or less uncertain than it was in the past.&#x201d; They also, Shiller notes, have a way of clustering around century turns&#x2014;as if the prospect of going from &#x2019;99 to &#x2019;00 is so fantastic as to make all things seem possible. In the new millennium, the residents of America&#x2019;s high culture thought, the Internet would change everything, making everyone who bought Internet stocks rich, no matter how much they paid. Those in the lower culture adapted that optimism to a belief in the investment potential of stuffed animals, and it&#x2019;s hard to say which view was proven more wrong. </p><p>_______</p><p>When I got home from the auction, I Googled Beanie Babies. There were pictures of Beanie Babies and stories noting that there had once been a craze for them, but nothing of any depth. Why had anyone ever thought Beanie Babies were a good investment? How had people decided that they were no longer worth anything? </p><p>There was also almost nothing on the man behind them. Ty Warner had an education that consisted of one year studying drama at Kalamazoo College and a net worth that <i>Forbes</i> estimated at $2.6 billion, all of it the product of the three-year Beanie Babies craze. That was enough to make him the 209th richest man in America. That was about the extent of the publicly available information about him. He hadn&#x2019;t done an interview since 1996, before the height of the craze, and no one who had known him personally or worked for him had ever spoken about him publicly. A <i>Chicago</i> magazine profile of Warner once described his life as hidden &#x201c;behind an impenetrable wall of plush.&#x201d;</p><p>Wondering whether there might be a story worth telling about Ty Warner and the Beanie Babies that had driven a large swath of America into a state of greed-fueled delusion, I called one of the handful of people connected to the company I found mentioned in an old news clipping: &#x201c;It was an incredible ride,&#x201d; a man named Bill Harlow told me. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s a shame it ended as badly as it did for us.&#x201d;</p><p>But don&#x2019;t focus on the negative, Harlow said. If you want to understand Ty Warner and how he became who he became, which was also the story of how Beanie Babies became what they became, he said, go see him at a toy and gift industry trade show. That was where Harlow had first met Warner in the late 1980s when Harlow was in his twenties, running a quilting store with his wife. Warner was in his forties&#x2014;a flamboyantly dressed, perfectly coiffed bit player in the sleepy industry of stuffed animals, fastidiously grooming his plush Himalayan cats, the first toys he&#x2019;d ever created. Everyone who saw him at trade shows in those days remembers him, usually alone, plucking around the cats&#x2019; eyes with tweezers to accentuate &#x201c;eye contact,&#x201d; as he put it, and blow-drying them to enhance the thickness of their fur. </p><p>Ty stopped the Harlows when they walked by his booth, asked them about their store, and then declared that nothing could possibly sell a quilt better than a stuffed cat sitting on top of it. They were skeptical, but they ordered when Ty&#x2019;s then girlfriend and business partner of sorts, Patricia Roche&#x2014;Patti, as Ty called her&#x2014;made the decision easier: &#x201c;I guarantee this order,&#x201d; she scribbled on the invoice, and signed it.</p><p>As it turned out, Warner was right. Cats sold quilts and quilts sold cats, and Harlow reordered quickly. That $125 order set in motion a chain of events that led to Harlow becoming the exclusive Ty Inc. distributor for all of Canada a few years later. At his peak, Harlow&#x2019;s annual revenue was more than $80 million&#x2014;a level of Canadian sales no other plush-toy seller had ever reached. Harlow became a multimillionaire in his thirties, and it just went to show: Ty Warner&#x2019;s presence at trade shows could lead to incredible things. A trade show, Harlow said: that was the place to see the king of the stuffed animals in his natural habitat. </p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>The Greatest Toy Show on Earth: No Kids Allowed</p><p>American International Toy Fair, February 2012, Javits Center, New York City</p><p>No children are admitted to the exhibit halls. Absolutely no one under the age of 18 (including infants and toddlers) is permitted to attend Toy Fair. There are no childcare facilities at the Javits Center.

Dust was brushed from the pink pedestals displaying stuffed bears, cats, and gorillas. A pair of handlers wielding lint brushes furiously patted down the costumes on the three people who, with the help of a cockney-accented jester, were promoting the company&#x2019;s latest toy: Monstaz, a line of small, round, multicolored beanbags that retail for around $6.99 and spew gibberish when you squeeze them. </p><p>&#x201c;Remember Beanies Babies?&#x201d; the jester asked a group of five onlookers. &#x201c;When everybody went c-c-c-craaazy?!&#x201d; he said, twirling his finger at his temple. It wasn&#x2019;t the cuteness, affordability, or long-term play value of Beanie Babies that he was evoking; it wasn&#x2019;t even the volume of sales. It was the memory that, for a few years, Beanie Babies had driven many Americans insane....</p></p><h2>Prophet, Vol. 1: Remission</h2><p><ul> <li>On distant future Earth, changed by time and alien influence, John Prophet awakens from cryosleep.

Controlling them both, Nero&#x2019;s mother, Julia Agrippina the Younger, Roman empress, great-granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus, sister of the Emperor Caligula, niece and fourth wife of Emperor Claudius.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>James Romm seamlessly weaves together the life and written words, the moral struggles, political intrigue, and bloody vengeance that enmeshed Seneca the Younger in the twisted imperial family and the perverse, paranoid regime of Emperor Nero, despot and madman.<br><br>Romm writes that Seneca watched over Nero as teacher, moral guide, and surrogate father, and, at seventeen, when Nero abruptly ascended to become emperor of Rome, Seneca, a man never avid for political power became, with Nero, the ruler of the Roman Empire. We see how Seneca was able to control his young student, how, under Seneca&#x2019;s influence, Nero ruled with intelligence and moderation, banned capital punishment, reduced taxes, gave slaves the right to file complaints against their owners, pardoned prisoners arrested for sedition. But with time, as Nero grew vain and disillusioned, Seneca was unable to hold sway over the emperor, and between Nero&#x2019;s mother, Agrippina&#x2014;thought to have poisoned her second husband, and her third, who was her uncle (Claudius), and rumored to have entered into an incestuous relationship with her son&#x2014;and Nero&#x2019;s father, described by Suetonius as a murderer and cheat charged with treason, adultery, and incest, how long could the young Nero have been contained?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><i>Dying Every Day</i> is a portrait of Seneca&#x2019;s moral struggle in the midst of madness and excess. In his treatises, Seneca preached a rigorous ethical creed, exalting heroes who defied danger to do what was right or embrace a noble death. As Nero&#x2019;s adviser, Seneca was presented with a more complex set of choices, as the only man capable of summoning the better aspect of Nero&#x2019;s nature, yet, remaining at Nero&#x2019;s side and colluding in the evil regime he created.<br><br><i>Dying Every Day</i> is the first book to tell the compelling and nightmarish story of the philosopher-poet who was almost a king, tied to a tyrant&#x2014;as Seneca, the paragon of reason, watched his student spiral into madness and whose descent saw five family murders, the Fire of Rome, and a savage purge that destroyed the supreme minds of the Senate&#x2019;s golden age.</p><p>James Romm is the James H.

Nero had&nbsp;grown up, and Seneca had grown old. The princeps had found new allies,&nbsp;among them another former tutor, a Greek freedman named Anicetus&nbsp;(&#x201c;Invincible&#x201d;). Nero had elevated this man to admiral of the Misenum&nbsp;fleet, a naval force he was grooming to be his own corps d&#x2019;�lite&#x2014;the Praetorians&nbsp;being more devoted to his mother. Other freedmen, slaves, and&nbsp;foreigners had begun to rise at court, men whose complete dependence&nbsp;and subservience gratified Nero. The voices that whispered against Seneca&nbsp;and Burrus had grown in number and stridency, and Nero had shown&nbsp;more willingness to listen.<br><br>It was to Anicetus, not to Seneca or Burrus, that Nero turned as he&nbsp;approached the great crisis of his reign, in the summer of 59. By that&nbsp;time, the young man&#x2019;s love for Poppaea had brought him to a pitch of&nbsp;dire resolve. He had decided on a crime that the future will believe with&nbsp;difficulty, and ages to come, with reluctance, as the play Octavia forecast&#x2014;correctly. He had decided to kill his mother.<br><br>It was what he had wanted to do years before but was prevented by Seneca&nbsp;and Burrus. Now, abetted by Anicetus, Nero found the courage to&nbsp;act. Perhaps Poppaea goaded him on, as Tacitus claims, by insisting she&nbsp;could never be his wife as long as Agrippina lived. But Nero needed no Lady Macbeth to harangue him into crime. He had already killed his&nbsp;adoptive brother on his own initiative; his mother posed a greater threat&nbsp;and caused him greater psychic torment.<br><br>Did Seneca take part in Nero&#x2019;s matricidal plan? Tacitus wondered but&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t know. Dio made Seneca chief instigator, though like much of his&nbsp;testimony on Seneca, this seems little more than slander. The question of&nbsp;collaboration is indeed hard to resolve. A princeps could not have easily&nbsp;hid such a plot from a high-ranked counselor, but perhaps Seneca no longer&nbsp;ranked very high. If Nero kept him in the dark, declining to consult&nbsp;his old ally against Agrippina, then relations between teacher and pupil&nbsp;had truly gone downhill. If Seneca was consulted, he may have seen he&nbsp;could not prevent Nero from acting but could at least help him succeed.&nbsp;Under that scenario, he may have consented to murder if it could be done&nbsp;cunningly, so as to look like an accident.<br><br>Cunning was indeed what was needed, for a daughter of Germanicus&nbsp;could not be attacked either with blades or legal writs. Poison too was&nbsp;out of the question; Agrippina, having long suspected Nero&#x2019;s intentions,&nbsp;had taken precautions, perhaps even fortifying herself with antidotes. A&nbsp;technologically savvy method was called for, and Nero was a great lover of&nbsp;technology. One day he saw in the theater, according to Dio, a collapsible&nbsp;boat that fell apart when a lever was worked, simulating a shipwreck. The&nbsp;idea took root in his obsessed mind. With a move as clean and remote as&nbsp;the proverbial push of a button, Nero could crush his mother, or drown&nbsp;her, or both, far out in the water and away from the public&#x2019;s eyes. He&nbsp;delegated the mission to Anicetus.<br><br>Constructing the trick ship in secret was no simple task. Anicetus no&nbsp;doubt recruited his best shipwrights at Misenum and also trained loyal&nbsp;sailors who would crew on the fateful voyage. Meanwhile Nero set about&nbsp;making up with his mother. The two had become estranged of late&#x2014;some breakup had followed their overly intimate union&#x2014; but Nero hastened&nbsp;to repair the breach. He had to regain Agrippina&#x2019;s trust enough to&nbsp;get her on that boat.<br><br>Writing in jocular tones, admitting to having lost his temper, Nero&nbsp;cajoled his mother into joining him at Baiae, the sumptuous resort surrounded&nbsp;by lakes and a quiet bay, for the celebration of that year&#x2019;s Quinquatria,&nbsp;a rite of Minerva held at the spring equinox.<br><br>Both Nero and his mother had villas at Baiae, as did many of the&nbsp;Roman elite. The place was famous for high living, loose morals, and&nbsp;easy pleasures, a den of vice that good men should shun, in the eyes&nbsp;of Seneca&#x2014; though he did sometimes go there. In his disdain, Seneca&nbsp;painted a vivid picture: &#x201c;Why do we need to see drunken men wandering&nbsp;the beach and boaters on riotous pleasure cruises, and the lakes resounding&nbsp;with songs of musicians? . . . Do you think Cato would ever have&nbsp;lived there, to count the adulteresses as they sail past, the many kinds&nbsp;of boats painted with vivid colors, the roses bobbing everywhere on the&nbsp;lake&#x2019;s surface?&#x201d; No was of course his answer, though he perhaps made the&nbsp;high season at Baiae sound more appealing than he meant to.<br><br>Boating was the great thing at Baiae. Because most of the villas stood&nbsp;along a curving shore, or across a small bay at Puteoli, partiers could get&nbsp;from house to house by boat, putting in at small private docks. In her&nbsp;grander days, Agrippina had plied these waters in a state warship rowed&nbsp;by picked sailors. Just down the coast from her villa, an estate called&nbsp;Bauli, was the naval station at Misenum, where such ships and crews&nbsp;stood ready. Now, though, it was a different boat that arrived from Misenum&nbsp;for her use, a luxury yacht fi tted out with regal ornaments, manned&nbsp;by a special crew&#x2014; many of them Anicetus&#x2019; trained assassins.<br><br>Nero had this boat moored at a Baiae villa, where he had arranged&nbsp;a grand dinner party in Agrippina&#x2019;s honor. He presented the boat to his&nbsp;mother after dinner as a gift. It was only one of the many filial gestures&nbsp;he made that night, in an effort to overcome her distrust. Agrippina had her guard up, for she had long suspected her son might seek her life. But the splendidly arrayed ship appealed to her vanity, and Nero&#x2019;s kisses, as he&nbsp;put her on board, seemed sincere.<br><br>It was a cloudless, windless night, &#x201c;with a calm that seemed sent by&nbsp;the gods to reveal the crime,&#x201d; as Tacitus says in one of his most memorable&nbsp;sentences. The ship slipped along through shallow water, on its&nbsp;coasting voyage from Baiae to Bauli. Agrippina reclined with a friend,&nbsp;Acerronia, on a special couch on the vessel&#x2019;s rear deck. The two women&nbsp;talked warmly of the evening&#x2019;s entertainment and of the fond attentions&nbsp;of Nero. Nearby stood another of Agrippina&#x2019;s entourage, her procurator&#x2014;manager of her estates&#x2014;Crepereius Gallus.<br><br>Without warning, a section of roofi ng above these three collapsed,&nbsp;slamming onto Gallus with the full force of its lead- reinforced weight.&nbsp;The man was immediately crushed to death.<br><br>Had Agrippina not been reclining on her couch, or had Acerronia not&nbsp;been sitting lower still as she bent over her friend&#x2019;s feet, both would have&nbsp;died with Gallus. But the couch saved them. Its back and arms extended&nbsp;high enough to block the force of the falling lead. The two women got out from under the lethal weight and emerged into a frantic scene.<br><br>Anicetus&#x2019; agents among the crew were trying to complete their mission.&nbsp;They had expected the ship to break apart and pitch Agrippina into&nbsp;the sea, but this had failed to happen. Confused and seemingly lacking a&nbsp;backup plan, they rushed about on the boat&#x2019;s splintered deck. Some had the idea of capsizing the craft by putting all their weight on one side. But&nbsp;other crewmen who were not part of the plot, perhaps surmising what&nbsp;their comrades were up to, countered them by running to the opposite&nbsp;side. Shouts echoed across the bay&#x2019;s still surface, barely heard, if at all, by&nbsp;those on shore.<br><br>As the boat gradually tipped, Agrippina and Acerronia slid into the&nbsp;water. Acerronia, perhaps failing to see the design behind the calamity,&nbsp;called out that she was Agrippina and asked for rescue. Her cries drew a&nbsp;hail of blows from oars and other naval gear, as nearby assassins saw a&nbsp;chance to finish their job. Acerronia was clubbed to death in the water,&nbsp;while Agrippina, who had kept a prudent silence, took only a hit on the shoulder. Glimpsing the lanterns of some fishing smacks nearby, she&nbsp;swam off unnoticed. Indefatigable to the last, she had escaped Nero&#x2019;s&nbsp;deathtrap.<br><br>Safely returned to Bauli, Agrippina reflected on her position. Nero&nbsp;clearly meant to kill her but had gone to extreme lengths to keep the&nbsp;crime secret. Her high stature as daughter of Germanicus, and her son&#x2019;s&nbsp;timidity, had prevented an open attack, and these might now be enough&nbsp;to save her. She sent a messenger to Nero to inform him of the night&#x2019;s&nbsp;events, pretending it had all been a freak accident. If she could feign trust&nbsp;in her son, prevent him from striking a second blow, she could somehow&nbsp;rally support and strengthen her position. Already crowds of well-wishers,&nbsp;festival-goers who had heard about the collapse of the ship, were gathered&nbsp;outside her villa. She had a fighting chance, if she could only survive this&nbsp;night.<br><br>Meanwhile at Baiae, Nero, accompanied by Anicetus, had fretted for&nbsp;hours awaiting word of the plot&#x2019;s outcome. The news that it had failed&nbsp;sent him into a tailspin. He knew that his mother would now spot his&nbsp;intentions. Wounded but not killed, Agrippina would become more dangerous than ever. She might march on his villa that very night with a band&nbsp;of armed slaves, or make her way back to Rome to denounce him before&nbsp;the Senate. Nero was determined that his mother must die before the&nbsp;next day dawned, but he had no idea how to proceed. In despair, he sent&nbsp;for his two senior counselors to be roused from their chambers&#x2014;Seneca&nbsp;and Burrus.<br><br>None of Seneca&#x2019;s meditations on morality, Virtue, Reason, and the&nbsp;good life could have prepared him for this. Before him, as he entered&nbsp;Nero&#x2019;s room, stood a frightened and enraged youth of twenty-three, his&nbsp;student and prot�g� for the past ten years. For the past fi ve, he had allied&nbsp;with the princeps against his dangerous mother. Now the path he had&nbsp;first opened for Nero, by supporting his dalliance with Acte, had led to a&nbsp;botched murder and a political debacle of the first magnitude. It was too&nbsp;late for Seneca to detach himself. The path had to be followed to its end.<br><br>Every word Seneca wrote, every treatise he published, must be read&nbsp;against his presence in this room at this moment. He stood in silence for&nbsp;a long time, as though contemplating the choices before him. There were&nbsp;no good ones. When he fi nally spoke, it was to pass the buck to Burrus.&nbsp;Seneca asked whether Burrus could dispatch his Praetorians to take Agrippina&#x2019;s life. <br><br>Now it was Burrus&#x2019; turn to face the awful choices that came with&nbsp;collaboration. He too declined to do what the situation, and what full&nbsp;loyalty to Nero, demanded. The Praetorians, he said, had too strong an&nbsp;allegiance to Agrippina, and to the memory of her father. He suggested&nbsp;that Anicetus and the sailors at Misenum finish what they had started.&nbsp;<br><br>Nero&#x2019;s old guard had temporized at a critical pass and thus ceded&nbsp;power to the new. Anicetus eagerly took on the task that Seneca and&nbsp;Burrus had cast off, and Nero instantly affirmed how highly he rated&nbsp;this boon. &#x201c;Only today did I get control of the empire,&#x201d; he declared,&nbsp;&#x201c;and it was a mere freedman who conferred such a great gift.&#x201d; This barb&nbsp;was aimed at Seneca who, despite having worked for a decade to firm up&nbsp;Nero&#x2019;s power, had now been found wanting. The sage&#x2019;s influence over the&nbsp;princeps, long in decline, had taken another lurch downward.<br><br>With opportune timing, the messenger sent earlier by Agrippina,&nbsp;Agerinus, now arrived with news of his mistress&#x2019;s &#x201c;accident.&#x201d; Nero was&nbsp;grateful for a pretext, however slim, to move openly against his mother.&nbsp;As Agerinus delivered his message, Nero dropped a sword by the man&#x2019;s&nbsp;feet and ordered him seized as an assassin. Then he dispatched Anicetus&nbsp;to Bauli.<br><br>It was well past midnight when Anicetus&#x2019; hit squad arrived at Agrippina&#x2019;s&nbsp;villa. In spite of the hour, the grounds and beach were thronged with&nbsp;Agrippina&#x2019;s well-wishers. Anicetus ordered them to disperse, then broke&nbsp;down the door and began removing household slaves.<br><br>Agrippina was in her bedroom with a lone servant, but even this last&nbsp;companion disappeared when armed men were heard in the house. The&nbsp;queen mother was alone when Anicetus and two other officers burst into her room. She had been hoping it was her messenger Agerinus arriving; his long delay meant she was still in grave danger.<br><br>Agrippina&#x2019;s only chance was to shame her attackers out of completing&nbsp;their mission, to remind them of the glory of her line. But she was&nbsp;exhausted, shaken from the night&#x2019;s ordeal, and wounded. The best she could manage, according to Tacitus, was to protest that Anicetus must have made some terrible mistake. Surely Nero would never order her&nbsp;death.<br><br>The captain accompanying Anicetus, a man named Herculeius,&nbsp;answered by hitting her on the head with a club. The other officer standing&nbsp;by, Obaritus, drew his sword. Agrippina was all out of stratagems.&nbsp;There was little left for her but to die.<br><br>Agrippina had been betrayed by those she had put in power, by Nero&nbsp;above all, but also by Burrus, Anicetus, and not least, Seneca. The sage&nbsp;she had rescued from Corsica, who owed all he had to her, had declined&nbsp;to raise his voice against her murder. Politics had first made bedfellows of&nbsp;her and Seneca&#x2014;in the literal sense, some claimed. But politics, and her&nbsp;son&#x2019;s disordered mind, had arranged things such that only one of them&nbsp;could survive.<br><br>The foremost woman of her age&#x2014;sister of one emperor, wife of a&nbsp;second, mother of a third, the last of Germanicus&#x2019; children&#x2014;was about&nbsp;to die, friendless, abandoned, alone. One last, bold gesture remained to&nbsp;her, a gesture reported by three ancient sources. The author of Octavia&nbsp;describes it best:<br><br>Dying and wretched, she makes one last request of her assassin:<br>to sink his lethal sword in her womb.<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where to bury your sword, right here&#x2014;<br>The place from which such a monster came. . . .&#x201d;<br>After those words, she lets her sad soul<br>seep out through savage wounds<br>together with a final groan.</p><h2>Tesoro</h2><p>Tesoro is a story of family, survival, and the formative power of the women in Salgado&#x2019;s life.

But a closer look reveals a world of activity&#x2014;mayflies dart, beetles dive, frogs spring, skunks shuffle, and owls swoop. As a young girl watches, the circle of life unfolds.

Stefano lives with his wife and children in Venice, Italy. Please visit his website at stefanovitale.com.PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2014;This straightforward depiction of the food chain focuses on a pond near the house of a little girl named Anna. The poetic text builds in a "This Is the House That Jack Built" fashion, starting with "the deep, still water" and then introducing "the jade green algae," "the mayfly nymph," "the diving beetle," "the loud bullfrog," and so on up the chain. In the early pages, death is quick and no-nonsense: fly, beetle, frog, and snake are easily devoured by larger predators. Once the furry animals appear, however, the author is more circumspect; the owl merely dives for the skunk, and the coyote stalks the raccoon. Above it all, Anna hears the howl of a coyote and looks out her window, subtly reinforcing humanity's place at the top of the hierarchy. Vitale's rich, colorful oil-on-wood illustrations are as poetic as the text in their depiction of the natural world. An appended "facts to pond-er" section offers more information about the animals included. A clear, child-friendly look at ecology, this book is destined to find a home in storytimes and classrooms.&#x2014;<i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Carroll County Public Library, MD</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book&#39;s design mirrors...a mind trying to comprehend the complexity of human loss. (Los Angeles Times, Thomas McGonigle)</p><p><strong>A gift &#x201c;book in a box&#x201d; by one of Britain&#x2019;s greatest modern writers, hailed as &#x201c;a triumph&#x201d; by <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>.</strong> B.S. Johnson&#x2019;s lost classic has been showered with praise: <em>New York Magazine</em> named <em>The Unfortunates</em> one of their Ten Best Books of 2008, listed in <em>The New York Times</em> 100 Notable Books of 2008, and <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> declared it to be &#x201c;his most daring work.&#x201d; <br> <br> A legendary 1960s experiment in form, <em>The Unfortunates</em> is B. S. Johnson&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;book in a box,&#x201d; in which the chapters are presented unbound, to be read in any order the reader chooses. A sportswriter, sent to a Midlands town on a weekly assignment, finds himself confronted by ghosts from the past when he disembarks at the train station. Memories of one of his best, most trusted friends, a tragically young victim of cancer, begin to flood through his mind as he attempts to go about the routine business of reporting a soccer match. <br> <em><br> The Unfortunates</em> is a book of passionate honesty and dark, courageous humor: a meditation on death and a celebration of friendship which also offers a remarkably frank self-portrait of its author.<p><strong>B. S. Johnson (Bryan Stanley Johnson)</strong> (1933-1973) was an English experimental novelist, poet, literary critic and filmmaker. He was born into a working-class family, was evacuated from London during World War II, and left school at sixteen to work as an accountant. However, he taught himself Latin in the evenings, and with this knowledge, managed to pass the university exam for King's College London. After he graduated Johnson wrote a series of increasingly experimental and often acutely personal novels. A critically acclaimed film adaptation of the last of the novels published while he was alive, <em>Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry</em> was released in 2000. Increasingly depressed by his failure to succeed commercially, and beset by family problems, Johnson committed suicide.</p><p><b>Jonathan Coe&nbsp;</b>is a journalist who writes for the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>London Review of Books</i>.

Reprint.&#34;</p><p>Robert C. Fulford, D.O., began practicing his unique approach to healing in 1941 and spent most of his career in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area, and later in Tucson, Arizona. He still lectures across America, instructing young doctors in healing techniques. Dr. Fulford lives and practices on a limited basis in rural Ohio.Readers of Andrew Weil's <i>Spontaneous Healing</i> (1995) will recognize Fulford, the osteopath whose remarkable success inspired Weil to seriously investigate "alternative" medicine. Now in his nineties, Fulford remains in (reduced) practice and here, with Stone's help, relays his advice for good health. That counsel arises from a conception of the body that is as holistic as many an Oriental medical system, as firmly based in love as Christianity. The body is composed of interdependent parts and functions; a problem manifested in one part or function may require ministering to others. Mental and emotional as well as physical traumas must be identified and treated, so Fulford seeks to know patients as persons. A good, individualized diet; easy, regular breathing; meditation; moderation in all things--especially, these days, in that other essential, exercise; and controlling desire are some of the things Fulford specifically enjoins. Given the sweetness of his voice and temperament as well as a large publicity effort by Pocket, his adviser just may match Weil's best-seller in popularity. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Desert Fathers and Mothers: Early Christian Wisdom Sayings&#x2015;Annotated &amp; Explained (SkyLight Illuminations)</h2><p><p><strong>Timeless and contemplative sayings from the earliest Christian sages of desert spirituality can be a companion on your own spiritual journey.</strong></p><p>The desert fathers and mothers were ordinary Christians living in solitude in the deserts of Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Arabia who chose to renounce the world in order to deliberately and individually follow God's call.

The author provides practical and useful information for both school administrators and classroom teachers."&lt;</i></p><p><strong>W. James Popham,</strong> professor emeritus at University of California Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, has spent the bulk of his educational career as a teacher. His first teaching assignment, for example, was in a small eastern Oregon high school where he taught English and social studies while serving as yearbook advisor, class sponsor, and unpaid tennis coach. That recompense meshed ideally with the quality of his coaching. <br><br>Most of Dr. Popham&#x2032;s teaching career took place at UCLA where, for nearly 30 years, he taught courses in instructional methods for prospective teachers as well as courses in evaluation and measurement for graduate students. At UCLA he won several distinguished teaching awards. In January 2000, he was recognized by <em>UCLA Today</em> as one of UCLA&#x2019;s top 20 professors of the 20th century. (He notes that the 20th century was a full-length century, unlike the current abbreviated one.) In 1992, he took early retirement from UCLA upon learning that emeritus professors received free parking. <br><br>Because at UCLA he was acutely aware of the perishability of professors who failed to publish, he spent his non-teaching hours affixing words to paper. The result: 30 books, 200 journal articles, 50 research reports, and 175 papers presented before research societies. Although not noted in his official vita, while at UCLA he also authored 1,426 grocery lists. <br><br>His most recent books are <em>Classroom Assessment: What Teachers Need to Know,</em> 6th Ed. (2010) and <em>Assessment for Educational Leaders </em>(2006), Allyn &amp; Bacon; <em>The Truth About Testing </em>(2001), <em>Test Better, Teach Better</em> (2003), <em>Transformative Assessment </em>(2008) and <em>Instruction that Measures Up </em>(2009) ASCD; <em>America&#x2019;s &#x201c;Failing&#x201d; Schools </em>(2005) and <em>Mastering Assessment </em>(2006), Routledge; and <em>Unlearned Lessons </em>(2009) Harvard Education Press. He encourages purchase of these books because he regards their semi-annual royalties as psychologically reassuring. <br><br>In 1978, Dr. Popham was elected to the presidency of the American Educational Research Association (AERA). He was also the founding editor of Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, a quarterly journal published by AERA. A Fellow of the Association, he has attended each year&#x2032;s AERA meeting since his first in 1958. He is inordinately compulsive. <br><br>In 1968, Dr. Popham established IOX Assessment Associates, an R&amp;D group that formerly created statewide student achievement tests for a dozen states. He has personally passed all of those tests, largely because of his unlimited access to the tests&#x2019; answer keys. <br><br>In 2002 the National Council on Measurement in Education presented him with its Award for Career Contributions to Educational Measurement. In 2006 he was awarded a Certificate of Recognition by the National Association of Test Directors. In 2009, he was appointed to be a board member of the National Assessment Governing Board.

It will be miles before it bends, carrying me out of sight of the upper windows of the grand house. I know what they see: a nothing, a nobody. A small, staunch figure, lonely in mourning black, stiff skirts rustling about my boots, cloak fast against the cold. A crisp black bonnet settled grim upon my head and ribbons whipped by the wind. What a desolate January traveler I must represent.<br> <br>Frost on the fields and upon the road, the village empty and forlorn, my boots leaving a trail of prints that peter into infinity. That is what they hope I will do&#x2014;vanish like a melted footprint. If I can, I will oblige them. My reason for being here, the only person I have ever loved, now lies beneath six feet of earth and thick, shadow-green boughs of yew in a quiet corner of the churchyard. She was laid there yesterday.<br> <br>The air is so cold that the tears are flayed from my eyes, eyes I had thought to be finished with crying for all time. After the biblical floods I have shed in the last three days, I thought there could be no water left in my depleted form. Yet it seems that life, and grief, and winter go on. My toes are numb as I trudge the miles that lead me away from Aurelia&#x2019;s grave and from Hatville Court, the only home, grudging as it was, that I have ever known.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Soon enough, it threatens dark. The sharpest sickle moon I have ever seen hangs razor-edged in a gray sky and ahead I see the silhouette of Ladywell, the next village. I have walked for hours.<br> <br>I stop there because I know I must, although my needs are not the sort to be assuaged by food, or ale, or fire. The chill in my bones is nothing to the freeze in my heart and no congenial company on earth could compensate me for the lack of Aurelia. But the next village is six miles yet farther and the lanes are awash with shadow. It would be the height of folly to go on; a young woman alone has ever been an easy target for villains. And although I have little faith that my life will ever again feel worthwhile, I still do not wish to throw it away. Aurelia may be gone, but she is not done with me yet. I will carry out her wishes in death every scrap as faithfully as I did when she was with me.<br> <br>I enter the Rose and Crown. With my second, secret legacy from Aurelia I could afford the White Harte Royal, a hotel of some repute. But news flows between Ladywell and Enderby. If it were heard at Hatville Court that Amy Snow was seen taking a room at the Harte, they would be after me tomorrow in their carriage like the hounds of hell. For then they would guess there is more to my legacy than meets the eye.<br> <br>The Rose and Crown will suffice. The chat in the lounge may not be the most refined for a young lady with a mind to her reputation, but then I am no lady; this has been made abundantly clear to me.<br> <br>I hesitate in the hall. What am I? Respectable young woman or guttersnipe? Servant, sister, or friend? My role in the tale of Aurelia Vennaway puzzles no one more than me, especially now that I am called upon to conclude it.<br> <br>&#x201c;May I help you, miss?&#x201d; A soft-spoken landlord approaches, clasping his hands as though anxious that his very presence might cause offense. How well I know that feeling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, sir. A room for the night, if you please, and perhaps a little supper&#x2014;nothing rich&#x2014;and a warming drink.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Certainly, miss, certainly. BELLA!&#x201d; His welcoming tone leaps to a bellow and a young maid pops into the hall like a jackrabbit from a hole.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bella, light the fire in the Barley Room and take the lady&#x2019;s bag there,&#x201d; he instructs, resuming his normal pitch. &#x201c;Might I recommend, miss, that you take supper in the lounge tonight? I would not suggest it except there is a blazing fire there and it will take a while for your room to reach a comfortable temperature. The lounge is quiet&#x2014;the cold is keeping many at home&#x2014;and, if you&#x2019;ll forgive me, you look frozen to the bone, Miss&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Snow.&#x201d;<br> <br>He looks at me then, understanding dawning. Bella stands with my bag stretching her skinny arm almost to the floor, gazing with frank curiosity until he orders her on her way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Begging your pardon, Miss Snow, if the lounge is acceptable, I will attend to you myself, ensure you are undisturbed. By the time you are fed, your room will be fit to receive you.&#x201d;<br> <br>His kindness brings fresh tears to my eyes, and only a supreme effort keeps them there.<br> <br>I take my supper in the lounge and though I can eat only a little, the warmth and flavor are somewhat fortifying. I do not linger but retire to a small, simple room which is, as promised, tolerably warm. I perform a rudimentary toilette in a daze.<br> <br>Whilst I walked I conceived the idea to write an account of my time and travels, so as to feel that my life has some substance, some witness. Alone in the silence, Aurelia&#x2019;s absence presses down upon me, but now is not the time to give in, not so very early on in my quest. I must be as strong as I need to be.<br> <br>I begin to write. Really, there is nothing else I can do.</p><h2>Kumeyaay Ethnobotany: Shared Heritage of the Californias</h2><p>&#34;For thousands of years, the Kumeyaay people of northern Baja California and southern California made their homes in the diverse landscapes of the region, interacting with native plants and continuously refining their botanical knowledge.

Visit him at GarryParsons.co.uk.George&#x2019;s Secret Key to the Universe <br><br> <br>Pigs don&#x2019;t just vanish, thought George as he stood staring into the depths of the very obviously empty pigsty. He tried closing his eyes and then opening them again, to see if it was all some kind of horrible optical illusion. But when he looked again, the pig was still gone, his vast muddy pink bulk nowhere to be seen. In fact, when George examined the situation for a second time, it had gotten worse, not better. The side door of the pigsty, he noticed, was hanging open, which meant someone hadn&#x2019;t shut it properly. And that someone was probably him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Georgie!&#x201d; he heard his mother call from the kitchen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to start supper in a minute, so you&#x2019;ve only got about an hour. Have you done your homework?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mom,&#x201d; he called back in a fake cheery voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s your pig?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s fine! Fine!&#x201d; said George squeakily. He threw in a few experimental oinks, just to make it sound as though everything was business as usual, here in the small backyard that was full of many, many vegetables and one enormous&#x2014;but now mysteriously absent&#x2014;pig. He grunted a few more times for effect&#x2014;it was very important his mother did not come out into the garden before George had time to think up a plan. How he was going to find the pig, put it back in the sty, close the door, and get back in time for supper, he had no idea. But he was working on it, and the last thing he needed was for one of his parents to appear before he had all the answers.<br> <br><br> <br>George knew the pig was not exactly popular with his parents. His mother and father had never wanted a pig in the backyard, and his dad in particular tended to grind his teeth quite hard when he remembered who lived beyond the vegetable patch. The pig had been a present: One cold Christmas Eve a few years back, a cardboard box full of squeaks and snuffles had been delivered to their front door. When George opened it up, he found a very indignant pink piglet inside. George lifted him carefully out of the box and watched with delight as his new friend skidded around the Christmas tree on his tiny hooflets. There had been a note taped to the box. Dear all! it read. Merry Christmas! This little fellow needs a home&#x2014;can you give him one? Love, Grandma xxx.<br> <br><br> <br>George&#x2019;s dad hadn&#x2019;t been delighted by the new addition to his family. Just because he was a vegetarian, it didn&#x2019;t mean he liked animals. Actually, he preferred plants. They were much easier to deal with: They didn&#x2019;t make a mess or leave muddy hoofprints on the kitchen floor or break in and eat all the cookies left out on the table. But George was thrilled to have his very own pig. The presents he&#x2019;d received from his mom and dad that year were, as usual, pretty awful. The home-knitted purple-and-orange striped sweater from his mom had sleeves that stretched right down to the floor; he had never wanted a xylophone, and he had a hard time looking enthusiastic when he unwrapped a build-your-own ant farm.<br> <br>What George really wanted&#x2014;above all things in the Universe&#x2014;was a computer. But he knew his parents were very unlikely to buy him one. They didn&#x2019;t like modern inventions and tried to do without as many standard household items as they could. Wanting to live a purer, simpler life, they washed all their clothes by hand and didn&#x2019;t own a car and lit the house with candles in order to avoid using any electricity.<br> <br>It was all designed to give George a natural and improving upbringing, free from toxins, additives, radiation, and other such evil phenomena. The only problem was that in getting rid of everything that could possibly harm George, his parents had managed to do away with lots of things that would also be fun for him. George&#x2019;s parents might enjoy going on environmental protest marches or grinding flour to make their own bread, but George didn&#x2019;t. He wanted to go to a theme park and ride on the roller coasters or play computer games or take an airplane somewhere far, far away. Instead, for now, all he had was his pig.<br> <br><br> <br>And a very fine pig he was too. George named him Freddy and spent many happy hours dangling over the edge of the pigsty his father had built in the backyard, watching Freddy root around in the straw or snuffle in the dirt. As the seasons changed and the years turned, George&#x2019;s piglet got bigger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and bigger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and bigger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until he was so large that in dim lighting he looked like a baby elephant. The bigger Freddy grew, the more he seemed to feel cooped up in his pigsty. Whenever he got the chance, he liked to escape and rampage across the vegetable patch, trampling on the carrot tops, munching the baby cabbages, and chewing up George&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s flowers. Even though she often told George how important it was to love all living creatures, George suspected that on days when Freddy wrecked her garden, she didn&#x2019;t feel much love for his pig. Like George&#x2019;s dad, his mom was a vegetarian, but George was sure he had heard her angrily mutter &#x201c;sausages&#x201d; under her breath when she was cleaning up after one of Freddy&#x2019;s more destructive outings.<br> <br>On this particular day, however, it wasn&#x2019;t the vegetables that Freddy had destroyed. Instead of charging madly about, the pig had done something much worse. In the fence that separated George&#x2019;s garden from the one next door, George suddenly noticed a suspiciously pig-sized hole. Yesterday it definitely hadn&#x2019;t been there, but then yesterday Freddy had been safely shut in his sty. And now he was nowhere to be seen. It meant only one thing&#x2014;that Freddy, in his search for adventure, had burst out of the safety of the backyard and gone somewhere he absolutely should not have gone.<br> <br>Next Door was a mysterious place. It had been empty for as long as George could remember. While all the other houses in the row had neatly kept backyards, windows that twinkled with light in the evenings, and doors that slammed as people ran in and out, this house just sat there&#x2014;sad, quiet, and dark. No small children squeaked with joy early in the morning. No mother called out of the back door to bring people in for supper. On the weekends, there was no noise of hammering or smell of fresh paint because no one ever came to fix the broken window frames or clear the sagging gutters. Years of neglect meant the garden had rioted out of control until it looked like the Amazon jungle had grown up on the other side of the fence.<br> <br>On George&#x2019;s side, the backyard was neat, orderly, and very boring. There were rows of string beans strictly tied to stakes, lines of floppy lettuces, frothy dark green carrot tops, and well-behaved potato plants. George couldn&#x2019;t even kick a ball without it landing splat in the middle of a carefully tended blueberry bush and squashing it.<br> <br><br> <br>George&#x2019;s parents had marked out a little area for George to grow his own vegetables, hoping he would become interested in gardening and perhaps grow up to be an organic farmer. But George preferred looking up at the sky to looking down at the earth. So his little patch of the planet stayed bare and scratchy, showing nothing but stones, scrubby weeds, and bare ground, while he tried to count all the stars in the sky to find out how many there were.<br> <br>Next Door, however, was completely different. George often stood on top of the pigsty roof and gazed over the fence into the glorious tangled forest beyond. The sweeping bushes made cozy little hidey-holes, while the trees had curved, gnarled branches, perfect for a boy to climb. Brambles grew in great clumps, their spiky arms bending into strange, wavy loops, crisscrossing each other like train tracks at a station. In summer, twisty bindweed clung on to every other plant in the garden like a green cobweb; yellow dandelions sprouted everywhere; prickly poisonous giant hogweed loomed like a species from another planet, while little blue forget-me-not flowers winked prettily in the crazy bright green jumble of Next Door&#x2019;s backyard.<br> <br><br> <br>But Next Door was also forbidden territory. George&#x2019;s parents had very firmly said no to the idea of George using it as an extra playground. And it hadn&#x2019;t been their normal sort of no, which was a wishy-washy, kindly, we&#x2019;re-asking-you-not-to-for-your-own-sake sort of no. This had been a real no, the kind you didn&#x2019;t argue with. It was the same no that George had encountered when he tried suggesting that, as everyone else at school had a television set&#x2014;some kids even had one in their bedroom!&#x2014;maybe his parents could think about buying one. On the subject of television, George had had to listen to a long explanation from his father about how watching mindless trash would pollute his brain. But when it came to Next Door, he didn&#x2019;t even get a lecture from his dad. Just a flat, conversation-ending no.<br> <br>George, however, always liked to know why. Guessing he wasn&#x2019;t going to get any more answers from his dad, he asked his mother instead.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, George,&#x201d; she had sighed as she chopped up Brussels sprouts and turnips and threw them into the cake mix. She tended to cook with whatever came to hand rather than with ingredients that would actually combine to make something tasty. &#x201c;You ask too many questions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just want to know why I can&#x2019;t go next door,&#x201d; George persisted. &#x201c;And if you tell me, I won&#x2019;t ask any more questions for the rest of the day. I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mom wiped her hands on her flowery apron and took a sip of nettle tea. &#x201c;All right, George,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you a story if you stir the muffins.&#x201d; Passing over the big brown mixing bowl and the wooden spoon, she settled herself down as George started to beat the stiff yellow dough with the green and white vegetable speckles together.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;When we first moved here,&#x201d; his mom began, &#x201c;when you were very small, an old man lived in that house. We hardly ever saw him, but I remember him well. He had the longest beard I&#x2019;ve ever seen&#x2014;it went right down to his knees. No one knew how old he really was, but the neighbors said he&#x2019;d lived there forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened to him?&#x201d; asked George, who&#x2019;d already forgotten that he&#x2019;d promised not to ask any more questions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody knows,&#x201d; said his mom mysteriously.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; asked George, who had stopped stirring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just that,&#x201d; said his mom. &#x201c;One day he was there. The next day he wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe he went on vacation,&#x201d; said George.<br> <br>&#x201c;If he did, he never came back,&#x201d; said his mom. &#x201c;Eventually they searched the house, but there was no sign of him. The house has been empty ever since and no one has ever seen him again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gosh,&#x201d; said George.<br> <br>&#x201c;A little while back,&#x201d; his mom continued, blowing on her hot tea, &#x201c;we heard noises next door&#x2014;banging sounds in the middle of the night. There were flashing lights and voices as well. Some squatters had broken in and were living there. The police had to throw them out. Just last week we thought we heard the noises again. We don&#x2019;t know who might be in that house. That&#x2019;s why your dad doesn&#x2019;t want you going around there, Georgie.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>As George looked at the big black hole in the fence, he remembered the conversation he&#x2019;d had with his mom. The story she&#x2019;d told him hadn&#x2019;t stopped him from wanting to go Next Door&#x2014;it still looked mysterious and enticing. But wanting to go Next Door when he knew he couldn&#x2019;t was one thing; finding out he actually had to was quite another. Suddenly Next Door seemed dark, spooky, and very scary.<br> <br>George felt torn. Part of him just wanted to go home to the flickery candlelight and funny familiar smells of his mother&#x2019;s cooking, to close the back door and be safe and snug inside his own house once more. But that would mean leaving Freddy alone and possibly in danger. He couldn&#x2019;t ask his parents for any help in case they decided that this was the final black mark against Freddy&#x2019;s name and packed him off to be made into bacon. Taking a deep breath, George decided he had to do it. He had to go Next Door.<br> <br>Closing his eyes, he plunged through the hole in the fence.<br> <br>When he came out on the other side and opened his eyes, he was right in the middle of the jungle garden. Above his head, the tree cover was so dense he could hardly see the sky. It was getting dark now, and the thick forest made it even darker. George could just see where a path had been trampled through the enormous weeds. He followed it, hoping it would lead him to Freddy.<br> <br>He waded through great banks of brambles, which grabbed at his clothes and scratched his bare skin. They seemed to reach out in the semidarkness to scrape their prickly spines along his arms and legs. Muddy old leaves squished under his feet, and nettles attacked him with their sharp, stinging fingers. All the while the wind in the trees above him made a singing, sighing noise, as though the leaves were saying, Be careful, Georgie&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be careful, Georgie.<br> <br><br> <br>The trail brought George into a sort of clearing right behind the house itself. So far he had not seen or heard any sign of his wayward pig. But there, on the broken paving stones outside the back door, he saw only too clearly a set of muddy hoofprints. From the marks, George could tell exactly which way Freddy had gone. His pig had marched straight into the abandoned house through the back door, which had been pushed open just wide enough for a fat pig to squeeze through. Worse, from the house where no one had lived for years and years, a beam of light shone.<br> <br>Somebody was home.</p><h2>The Great Prostate Hoax: How Big Medicine Hijacked the PSA Test and Caused a Public Health Disaster</h2><p><p>Every year, more than a million men undergo painful needle biopsies for prostate cancer, and upward of 100,000 have radical prostatectomies, resulting in incontinence and impotence. But the shocking fact is that most of these men would never have died from this common form of cancer, which frequently grows so slowly that it never even leaves the prostate. How did we get to a point where so many unnecessary tests and surgeries are being done? In <i>The Great Prostate Hoax</i>, Richard J. Ablin exposes how a discovery he made in 1970, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), was co-opted by the pharmaceutical industry into a multibillion-dollar business. He shows how his discovery of PSA was never meant to be used for screening prostate cancer, and yet nonetheless the test was patented and eventurally approved by the FDA in 1994. Now, doctors and victims are beginning to speak out about the harm of the test, and beginning to search for a true prostate cancer-specific marker.</p></p><p><p>Richard J. Ablin, PhD, DSc (HON) is a professor of Pathology at University of Arizona College of Medicine.

By morning, only one nurse, Corazon Amurao, had miraculously survived, and her scream of terror was heard around the world.As the eight bodies were carried out of the small building, the coroner, who had seen the carnage up close, told a gathering crowd: "It is the crime of the century!"Now, on the 50th anniversary of the murders, the prosecutor who put Speck in prison for life (William J.

Hawking has authored or participated in the creation of numerous other popular science books, including <i>On the Shoulders of Giants</i> and <i>The Illustrated On the Shoulders of Giants.</i>Acclaimed physicist Hawking has collected in this single illuminating volume the classic works of physics and astronomy that in their day revolutionized humankind's perception of the world. Included are Copernicus's On the Revolution of Heavenly Spheres, Galileo's Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences, Kepler's "Harmony of the World," Newton's The Principia and selections from The Principle of Relativity by Einstein. Taken together, these writings document the evolution of our conception of the universe from a pre-Copernican cosmos with a stationary earth at its center to one in which the very weave of time and space are relative. The editor's ability to step back and view the sweep of his subject was first showcased in his bestselling A Brief History of Time and confirmed in his The Universe in a Nutshell. In an essay introducing each work here, he gives a short and sweet biography of its author and an explanation of its significance, as well as the occasional gem, like Galileo's handwritten renunciation of his beliefs before the Inquisition. To read the works themselves is to feel the thrill and mystery of intimacy with oft-cited source documents.

Their knitted birds are the whimsical designs of two creative people, who write as one about &#x2018;designer birds&#x2019;: birdies that began as Christmas decorations, knitted in one color, as well as ones patterned after real birds, the kind that fly about the men's Norse home. This brightly colored book introduces the flock's expansion into winter and spring birds, green birds embroidered with sequins and contrasting flow, and birds of paradise. The authors figure their readers already know how to knit and have most of the trappings, including bits of yarn left over from bigger projects. The first chapter, which includes the basic pattern (repeated for easy reference on the back overlays), explains the materials and gauges needed for knitting, filling, and decorating as well for the wire stands that keep the wagtail, turdus, and titmouse from flopping over.

With all four books, the complete text, in one volume, translated and annotated by the noted scholars, magicians and astrologers John Michael Greer and Christopher Warnock, Picatrix takes its rightful place as an essential occult text for modern esotericists. The Illustrated Picatrix contains over 120 illustrations, with images of the 7 planets and 28 Mansions of the Moon by Nigel Jackson as well as images of the 36 decans and 12 signs by Renaissance artists. This is an authentic ancient magical text, lucidly translated and fully annotated with over 400 footnotes.</p><p>I was first introduced to Picatrix in 1998 by my magical teacher, Robert Zoller. At that time it was only available in Latin. What Latin I now have, I learned from working with Picatrix. John Greer and I worked together for over two years on this translation, and now finally, a complete and usable English translation of Picatrix is available.<br><br>This translation is indeed complete, including all four books of Picatrix, the most famous grimoire of astrological magic. We used the Pingree's Latin critical edition, so this translation is authoritative, relying on multiple manuscripts, rather than on a single variant. Why translate from the Latin? Well, firstly John Greer, my co-translator, is an excellent Latinist, but neither of us has a sufficient grasp of medieval Arabic. However, what I do have is a mastery of traditional astrology. Picatrix is so heavily astrological that the non-expert is completely lost when it comes to making an intelligible translation. Some other translations, despite ostensibly being from Arabic, have suffered greatly from an almost complete lack of astrological knowledge, leaving large sections incoherent and incomprehensible.<br><br>By contrast, our translation of the Picatrix reveals its true sweep and splendor as Picatrix is both an exhaustive manual of practical astrological magic as well as an expansive treatise on the Hermetic philosophy of astrology, alchemy and magic. This translation includes an extensive introduction and copious annotations, over 450 footnotes for 300 pages of text!<br><br>Like Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy which relies heavily on it, Picatrix represents the distillation of many earlier works. Written circa AD 1000 in Moorish Spain and translated into Latin in 1256 at the court of the Castilian king Alphonso the Wise, Picatrix is an authentic ancient work. The author says he consulted over 200 books of magic, astrology and alchemy. Picatrix was and still remains the premier grimoire of astrological magic, the highest of high magic, combining, as it does, ceremonial magic with the precise timing of traditional astrology. Picatrix explains how to create hundreds of different types of astrological talismans, including planetary, Mansions of the Moon, decan/face and house based talismans. Picatrix includes extensive planetary invocations and ritual from the pagan Sabians of Harran, renowned medieval magicians and astrologers. Sublime Neoplatonic and Hermetic philosophy bumps shoulders with "confections" of the brain of a black dove or blood sacrifice.<br><br>We have been very careful to produce an authoritative translation of the Latin Picatrix, which will satisfy both scholarly interest as well as be of use to the contemporary practitioner. The various editions of the Picatrix, for example, this edition, the Illustrated Picatrix and the Liber Atratus, both available through Amazon, or other editions, including the Liber Rubeus and Liber Viridis Green Magic edition and deluxe large format color Illustrated Picatrix, available through the Renaissance Astrology website, all have the same authoritative, complete translation of Picatrix, newly revised from our earlier versions. The separate editions have different formatting and fonts, and add to the complete translation, additional useful and interesting material.&nbsp; The Illustrated Picatrix includes gorgeous black and white images by Nigel Jackson of the 7 planets and 28 Mansions of the Moon using the specific Picatrix descriptions which add greatly to the beauty and utility of this edition. <br><br>Despite its popularity among mages, Picatrix was never published until the modern era.

But is that really the best way?&nbsp;<br><br>In <i>Diaper-Free Before 3</i>, Dr. Jill Lekovic presents the new case that early training&#x2014;beginning as early as nine months olds&#x2014;is natural, healthy, and beneficial for your child, based on medical evidence. By incoporating the potty into your child's routine early on, toilet training becomes far less stressful for both parent and child. Dr. Lekovic's method, which she has used successfully with her own kids and recommends to patients, helps children become better aware of their body's signals, boosts confidence, and decreases the risk of urinary health problems.&nbsp;<br><br>The guide includes informative chapters on bedwetting, accidents, and adapting the method for day care, special-needs children, and older toddlers. Offering a technique that really works and turns toilet training into a positive experience, <i>Diaper-Free Before 3</i> is sure to become a new parenting classic.</p><p>Chapter 1<br><br> What's wrong with the idea of readiness?<br><br> The parents of a healthy one-year-old boy, Jake, bring him in for his regular checkup. His growth is normal and his parents report that he started taking a few steps on his own over the last few weeks. He says "mommy" and "daddy," shakes his head no and yes, and looks around for his shoes or favorite toys when they are mentioned. He was weaned from the breast two months ago and now only takes a bottle before bed and nap. He loves a variety of foods and does well drinking from a cup.<br><br> Jake wears disposable diapers, and his parents have noticed that his diaper is often dry after a nap and that his bowel movements are usually after breakfast and dinner. He is curious about the toilet and wants to go in with his parents. He loves to have his diaper off and even tries to take it off himself at times. Jake's paternal grandmother got him a little potty chair for his first birthday, and his parents have a lot of concerns about when to introduce it. Their friends have told them that it is "way too early to even think about it." They want to know how to tell if he is ready to be toilet trained, and how to avoid making any mistakes along the way.<br><br> Is Jake ready to be toilet trained? Most doctors and parenting books recommend that children must show signs of readiness before beginning toilet training. Different experts list various skills, but most suggest that children require some communication skills, a desire to use the potty, and the ability to walk to the potty before being trained. Before you decide when it is best to start training your child, you should know that these guidelines (and the very idea of readiness) are based on the well-publicized opinions of a few individuals (not medical research), and are by no means infallible.<br><br> When you look at the history of potty training, how it was done in the past and under different circumstances, and how we came to consider the readiness guidelines to be the standard, you will begin to question what you have been told and to seriously reconsider what is best for your child. Despite the fact that a review published in the May 1999 issue of Pediatric Annals stated that "there is little question that children can be toilet trained by 1 year of age," most parents (and doctors) are not even aware that there is a well-established alternative to toilet training based on readiness skills.<br><br> Over the last century, changes in American lifestyles have been complex and far-reaching. Many of the changes in the perception of children and the practice of child-rearing are closely linked with these more general trends in our society. The most influential development with regard to toilet training was the introduction of Dr. T. Berry Brazelton's child-centered approach to training, a concept that has led to the current American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for toilet training. In this chapter I will explain the current guidelines and how they evolved. I will also explain how this approach is based on a false set of assumptions and theories (many of which have subsequently been established in the medical community to be mistaken). The readiness approach may actually pose multiple health risks to your child, inadvertently impeding her natural course of development.<br><br> The American Academy of Pediatrics<br><br> Guidelines for Toilet Training<br><br> The idea behind child-centered training is that children show various signs (related to their overall development) when they are ready to be trained. The AAP lists several signs of readiness, including:<br><br> *The ability to walk to the potty<br><br> *The ability to understand and follow one- and two-step commands<br><br> *Adequate language skills to express needs and wishes<br><br> *The child's desire for independent control of bowel and bladder function<br><br> The guidelines suggest that once you see these signs of readiness in your child you should gradually introduce your child to the potty. Most people see these signs begin to emerge during the second year of life, and the usual time to start training based on these guidelines is around two years of age. However, observing development is very subjective, and many children do not have much useful vocabulary in the second year of life. Many people see verbal communication skills (or a lack thereof) as an obstacle to potty training their child based on these guidelines, and they put off training because they do not know how to train a child who can't (or won't) tell them when he needs to go. Furthermore, the child's desire for control must be recognized by the caregiver and can mean anything (depending on the parent's interpretation) from pulling off the diaper to wandering into the bathroom to actually asking to use the potty. That means a child could seem ready at twelve months, or not until he is three years old, just based on how much he talks (a skill that has nothing to do with actually using the toilet), or on how curious he seems to be about the toilet. A lot of this has to do with the parent's expectations, and if she does not think a child can be trained at fifteen months of age, she will not think her child's curiosity about the potty has anything to do with toileting readiness.<br><br> Although these guidelines are well intentioned, they are based on some faulty assumptions and have led to some huge delays in toilet training and unforeseen consequences. The average age for completion of training has advanced from before eighteen months (in the 1970s) to thirty-six months and beyond. The AAP guidelines are completely open to interpretation and have not provided adequate guidance to help parents understand their children's development. There has been a shift in what we recognize in our children's behavior and abilities, leading to even further delays in training. There are no instructions about the use of disposable diapers or suggestions about when it might be appropriate to stop using them. There are also no comments about accidents, how many to expect or consider normal, or how to handle them. Finally, the idea that it is potentially harmful to your child to introduce the potty before he is ready is neither based on any medical facts nor supported by the many studies that have been done on this topic.<br><br> Dr. T. Berry Brazelton<br><br> The guidelines used by the AAP developed (to a large degree) from the work of Dr. T. Berry Brazelton. Dr. Brazelton's approach centers on the signs of readiness from the child, such as communication skills to express needs and motor skills to be independent with the task. He advised mothers to gradually introduce their infants to the potty after eighteen months of age, which at the time of his study was a huge delay for most people. He urged parents to avoid using pressure, in order to facilitate the infant's independent control of toileting. He argued that bowel control at age two or three was strictly a developmental task (or something that a child will "grow into"), as opposed to a skill that needed to be taught or practiced.<br><br> These recommendations evolved from Brazelton's famous 1962 article called "A Child-Oriented Approach to Toilet Training." In the introduction to this article he states: "Since the advent of streamlined diaper care has liberated mothers in our culture from the real need to 'train' their children early, this step may be viewed more honestly as a major developmental task for the child." I realize that I am looking at this from a different point of view, but who says women needed to be "liberated" from caring for their children? Furthermore, how could the invention of disposable diapers made of paper and plastic materials that were created in the last few decades (after human beings have been dealing with this issue for thousands of years) allow us to finally see the task more "honestly"? It simply does not make sense. It was the same (patriarchal) medical establishment that convinced an entire generation of women that giving their babies formula saved them from the onerous, time-consuming, and unseemly task of breast-feeding. Since then, it has become evident that there are many health benefits to breast-feeding (not to mention some mothers who think it is a wonderful, important experience to share with their babies).<br><br> Brazelton relied heavily on psychoanalytic theory to make the case that delaying toilet training was not only more convenient but also desirable from a developmental standpoint. He argued that children trained at a younger age were more prone to regression under pressure (or having accidents), and that this could be avoided by confronting this task at a more advanced stage of development. Writes Brazelton:<br><br> Parents and pediatricians are aware that the child's autonomous achievement in any developmental area frees him to progress to more advanced areas. Faulty mastery may leave him with a deficit that results in regression under stress. [Pathological symptoms such as constipation and enuresis] . . . usually reflect a fundamental psychological disturbance in the child's adjustment.<br><br> In short he felt that there was a connection between problems with potty training and the child's psychological well-being. This was not a new idea (I discuss a little history in Chapter 2), but Brazelton popularized it in a way that changed how everyone viewed toilet training. He took toilet training from being a natural part of a child's growth development and made it one with special psychological significance.<br><br> Myth #1: Toilet Training Has<br><br> Special Importance in Children's<br><br> Psychological Development<br><br> Many experts have questioned the connection between toilet training and psychological disturbance in children over the years. Even one of the most popular and well-regarded pediatric reference textbooks, Nelson's, states: "There is little to indicate that the experiences involved in the toilet training of most children are of major psychological consequence." Of course being negative, humiliating, or punishing a child as a part of toilet training can damage her self-esteem and cause her to resist training. But these patterns reflect an underlying parental approach and attitude that impacts all areas of child development, not just toilet training. You should use the same measure of patience, flexibility, and love with toilet training that you do with all of parenting.<br><br> Myth #2: Babies Don't Know When<br><br> They Are Voiding<br><br> Since Brazelton did his 1962 study, we have increased knowledge about the developing nervous system in babies and children. As part of his argument for later training, Brazelton referred to theories suggesting that babies are born with a simple reflex occurring at the level of the nerves in the spinal cord, which causes them to empty their bladder when it is full. The idea was that as the bladder fills, certain nerves sense it is full and those nerves directly set off a corresponding set of nerves that lead to the bladder being emptied. According to Brazelton's theory, voluntary control of voiding happens only when the brain matures enough to begin to control this simple reflex. This is clearly not the case, as the current medical evidence proves.<br><br> Today's experts have found that newborn babies already have brain-based control over voiding related to arousal. In fact PET scans have shown that specific areas of the brain become active in newborn babies before they empty their bladders. This means that the higher functions of the brain are getting some sensory input and then exerting control over the bladder in a way that is much more complex than a spinal reflex arc, even before birth. There are certain stages in the sleep cycle when the bladder does not empty. This fascinating area is wide open to research, but it is clear that Brazelton's assertions do not explain the system. The idea that there is a transition at some point in the child's development from reflex voiding to voluntary voiding, or any point when higher functions of the nervous system are not involved in voiding, has been completely discredited. So these facts shift the question from being "When does a baby's brain become involved in voiding?" to "When does a baby become consciously aware of these processes?"<br><br> This question of conscious awareness in babies presents itself in many forms. Parents often see their newborn baby smile, and many have asked me when babies know they are smiling or begin to smile on purpose. Usually I give a simplistic explanation that there are many expressions that occur spontaneously in babies, but they begin to recognize and smile at caregivers after about six weeks of age. The real answer is a little more complicated, but analogous to toilet training.<br><br> Facial expressions in babies can represent spontaneous events, or they can be responses to stimuli as simple as the discomfort of being cold or having gas or as complex as a feeling of comfort, fear, or even happiness. The differences among when your baby is unconsciously moving his facial muscles, when he is responding to his environment with reflexive grimaces and smiles, when he is imitating the expression of a caregiver, and when he is making the connection among seeing a caregiver, feeling happy, and deciding to smile about it are not measurable, at least with what is currently known about the cognitive development of humans. They occur over time and not at a single moment.<br><br> Bladder and bowel control are similar things in that there is a gap between what is possible in terms of conditioned behavior and when babies become aware of the process in the complex sense that involves anticipation, planning, and communication. This complex but completely apparent fact directly confronts the idea that the signs of readiness suggested by the Academy have real significance. As much as we wonder as parents what our babies think and feel when they smile, we accept that we really don't know, and we continue to smile and talk to them as they grow. The same should be true with potty training. There is no specific age when children become aware (or for that matter any age when we know that they are not aware) of their toileting needs. We should offer them cues to tune in to the signals from their bodies (see your baby flushed and grunting, take him to the potty, he feels relaxed sitting on the potty, and he has a bowel movement).<br><br> Myth #3: Early Training Causes<br><br> More Frequent Accidents<br><br> This assertion has been completely disproven many times over since it was first made. In fact there is no evidence that children trained early have any increase in the amount or frequency of accidents throughout childhood. The opposite is true; children trained earlier have much more reliable and consistent control than older children who often make accidents one of their tools in their ongoing power struggle with caregivers. Most children go through episodes of increased frequency of accidents after they have been trained, and there does not seem to be any association between training method and these periods.<br><br> Brazelton advanced the theory that the ability to be voluntarily trained (and thus to be able to control accidents) correlated with development of certain parts of the central nervous system that control voluntary motor functions. He argued that this process occurs between twelve and eighteen months of age, and any training prior to that time would lead a child to regress when she entered later stages of development.&#x201c;Using medical studies and other parenting literature, pediatrician and mother Lekovic challenges conventional potty-training wisdom and presents a plan to get you baby out of diapers as early as age two.&#x201d; &#x2014;From the University of Chicago Magazine, April 2006</p><h2>The Way of the Writer: Reflections on the Art and Craft of Storytelling</h2><p>From Charles Johnson&#x2014;a National Book Award winner, Professor Emeritus at University of Washington, and one of America&#x2019;s preeminent scholars on literature and race&#x2014;comes an instructive, inspiring guide to the craft and art of writing.<br><br>An award-winning novelist, philosopher, essayist, screenwriter, professor, and cartoonist, Charles Johnson has devoted his life to creative pursuit.

In the Beginning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<p></p> <br>People sometimes wonder what a person was like before he or she became a writer. What was that person&#x2019;s childhood like? In my case, I imagine that my being an only child growing up in the 1950s in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, in the shadow of Northwestern University, shaped my life in more ways than I can imagine.<br> <br>I was born on April 23 (Shakespeare&#x2019;s birthday), 1948, at a place I described in my novel Dreamer: Community Hospital, an all-black facility. In my novel I renamed this important institution &#x201c;Neighborhood Hospital,&#x201d; and called the woman who spearheaded its creation, Dr. Elizabeth Hill, by the fictionalized name Jennifer Hale. In the late 1940s, Dr. Hill&#x2014;one of Evanston&#x2019;s first black physicians&#x2014;was barred by segregation from taking her patients to all-white Evanston Hospital. Instead, she was forced to take them to a hospital on the South Side of Chicago, and quite a few of her patients died in the ambulance on the way. Almost single-handedly (or so I was told as a child), Dr. Hill organized black Evanstonians (and some sympathetic whites) to create a black hospital. Our family patriarch, my great-uncle William Johnson, whose all-black construction crew (the Johnson Construction Co., which this book honors on its title page) built churches, apartment buildings, and residences all over the North Shore area, would go nowhere else for treatment, even after Evanston Hospital was integrated in the 1950s. And every black baby born to my generation in Evanston came into the world there&#x2014;my classmates and I all had in common the fact that we had been delivered by Elizabeth Hill. She considered us her &#x201c;children.&#x201d; Even when I was in my early twenties she knew me by sight and would ask what I&#x2019;d been up to since I last saw her.<br> <br>Predictably, then, I grew up in a black community in the 1950s that had the feel of one big, extended family. Ebenezer A.M.E. Church, where I was baptized (and later my son) and married, was a central part of our collective lives. In an atmosphere such as this, everybody knew their neighbors and saw them in church on Sunday; it was natural for grown-ups to keep an eye on the welfare of their neighbors&#x2019; children and to help each other in innumerable ways. In short, Evanston in the 1950s was a place where, beyond all doubt, I knew I was loved and belonged.<br> <br>My father worked up to three jobs to ensure our family never missed a meal. We weren&#x2019;t poor, but neither were we wealthy or middle-class. Every so often my mother took a job to help make ends meet, including one at Gamma Phi Beta sorority at Northwestern University, where she worked as a cleaning woman during the Christmas holidays. She brought me along to help because she couldn&#x2019;t afford a babysitter. I remember her telling me that the sorority&#x2019;s chapter said no blacks or Jews would ever be admitted into its ivied halls. My mother brought home boxes of books thrown out by the sorority girls when classes ended, and in those boxes I found my first copies of Mary Shelley and Shakespeare. I read them, determined that the privileged girls of that sorority would never be able to say they knew something about the Bard that the son of their holiday cleaning woman didn&#x2019;t. Decades later in 1990 Northwestern&#x2019;s English department actively and generously pursued me for employment by offering me a chair in the humanities, which I declined.<br> <br>Along with those books from Northwestern, my mother filled our home with books that reflected her eclectic tastes in yoga, dieting, Christian mysticism, Victorian poetry, interior decorating, costume design, and flower arrangement. On boiling hot Midwestern afternoons in late July when I was tired of drawing (my dream was to become a cartoonist and illustrator), I would pause before one of her many bookcases and pull down a volume on religion, the Studs Lonigan trilogy, poetry by Rilke, The Swiss Family Robinson, Richard Wright&#x2019;s Black Boy, an 1897 edition of classic Christian paintings (all her books are now in my library), or Daniel Blum&#x2019;s Pictorial History of the American Theatre 1900&#x2013;1956, which fascinated me for hours. She was always in book clubs, and I joined one, too, to receive monthly new works of science fiction when I was in my middle teens. (Believe it or not, I had a hardcover first edition of Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s The Man in the High Castle, which I&#x2019;ve always regretted letting slip away from me.)<br> <br>As an only child, books became my replacement for siblings. Exposed to so many realms of the imagination, I vowed to read at least one book a week after I started at Evanston Township High School (from which, by the way, my mother had graduated in the late thirties). I started with adventure stories like those by Ian Fleming and ended my senior year with Plutarch&#x2019;s Lives of the Noble Grecians. I spent hours each week at a newsstand selecting the next paperback I&#x2019;d spend several days of my life with. And, as might be expected, it happened that one week I finished early&#x2014;on a Tuesday, I recall&#x2014;and I thought, &#x201c;God, what do I do now with the rest of the week?&#x201d; So I read a second book. Then it became easy to make it three books a week, and I did think&#x2014;but only once&#x2014;that someday it might be nice to have my name on the spine of a volume I&#x2019;d written.<br> <br>And so, again, ours was a house not just of provocative books but also inexpensive and intriguing (to me) art objects that Mother found at flea markets and rummage sales. When she couldn&#x2019;t find them, she built them&#x2014;for example, wall shelves with interesting designs to hold small figurines. We&#x2019;d read the same books together sometimes, Mother and me, and discuss them. I think she relied on me for this, even raised me to do it, since my hardworking father had little time for books. She had the soul of an actress, a biting wit, and loved art. She&#x2019;d always wanted to be a teacher, but couldn&#x2019;t because she suffered from severe bouts of asthma. So she made me her student. Like so many other things I owe to my mother, I am indebted to her for seducing me with the beauty of blank pages&#x2014;a diary she gave me to record my thoughts. But this was by no means a new infatuation. As with books, it was into drawing that I regularly retreated as a child. There was something magical to me about bringing forth images that hitherto existed only in my head where no one could see them. I remember spending whole afternoons blissfully seated before a three-legged blackboard my parents got me for Christmas, drawing and erasing until my knees and the kitchen floor beneath me were covered with layers of chalk and the piece in my hand was reduced to a wafer-thin sliver.<br> <br>Something to understand about Evanston in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s is that, unlike many places, the public schools were integrated. From the time I started kindergarten I was thrown together with kids of all colors, and I found it natural to have friends both black and white. Evanston Township High School, we were constantly reminded, was, at the time, rated the best public high school in the nation. It was a big school, almost like a small college&#x2014;my graduating class had almost a thousand students; black students made up 11 percent of that population. In its progressive curriculum we found an education provided, clearly, by the wealthy white Evanston parents who sent their children there. I took advantage of all the art and photography, literature and history classes.<br> <br>And to its credit, ETHS offered a yearly creative-writing class taught by the short-story writer Marie-Claire Davis. At the time she was publishing in the Saturday Evening Post. As an aspiring cartoonist, I thought writing stories was fun and I came alive in my literature classes, where we read Orwell, Shakespeare, Melville, and Robert Penn Warren, but writing wasn&#x2019;t the kick for me that drawing was. Regardless, I let a buddy talk me into enrolling in Marie&#x2019;s class with him. We talked to each other the whole time and barely listened to poor Marie. But she put Joyce Cary&#x2019;s lovely book Art and Reality in front of us, without discussing it in class, and with the hope that we might read it on our own, which I did, and something in me so enjoyed his essays on art and aesthetics that I thought, yes, someday I&#x2019;d like to do a book like this, too. (You might say you&#x2019;re holding that book in your hands right now.) When I turned in my three stories for Marie&#x2019;s class in 1965, she rushed them into print in the literary section of our school&#x2019;s newspaper (with my illustrations), which she supervised. I always feel indebted to her. And so in the 1990s I established an award, the Marie-Claire Davis Award, at the high school&#x2014;$500 for the best senior student portfolio of creative writing. For years before her death, Marie would travel from Florida to shake the hand of the winner of that award.<br> <br>Inevitably, the passion for drawing led me to consider a career as a professional artist. From the Evanston Public Library I lugged home every book on drawing, cartooning, and illustration, and collections of early comic art (Cruikshank, Thomas Rowlandson, Daumier, Thomas Nast), and pored over them, considering what a wonderful thing it would be&#x2014;as an artist&#x2014;to externalize everything I felt and thought in images. Some Saturday mornings I sat on the street downtown with my sketchbook, trying to capture the likenesses of buildings and pedestrians. And I made weekly trips to Good&#x2019;s Art Supplies to buy illustration board with my allowance and money earned from my paper route (and later from a Christmas job working nights until dawn on the assembly line at a Rand McNally book factory in Skokie, and from still another tedious after-school job cleaning a silks-and-woolens store where well-heeled white women did their shopping). Good&#x2019;s was a little store packed to the ceiling with the equipment&#x2014;the tools&#x2014;I longed to buy. The proprietor, a fat, friendly man, tolerated my endless and na�ve questions about what it was like to be an artist and what materials were best for what projects; he showed me a book he&#x2019;d self-published on his theory of perspective (I never bought it), and after he&#x2019;d recommended to me the best paper for my pen-and-ink ambitions, I strapped my purchase onto the front of my bicycle and pedaled home.<br> <br>For a Christmas present my folks finally did buy me one of Good&#x2019;s drawing tables, new for $25. I made space for it in my bedroom and set it up like a shrine. That table would carry me through two years of drawing furiously for my high school newspaper (my senior year, in 1966, I received two second-place awards in the sports and humor divisions for a comic strip and panel from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association&#x2019;s national contest for high school cartoonists), through my first professional job as an illustrator when I was seventeen&#x2014;drawing for the catalog of a magic-trick company in Chicago. And then that first drawing table was with me, like an old friend, for the next four years of college when I drew thousands of panel cartoons, political cartoons, illustrations (even the design for a commemorative stamp), and every kind of visual assignment for my college newspaper, for the Chicago Tribune (where I interned in 1969, then worked for as a stringer when I returned to college), for a newspaper in southern Illinois, and for many magazines known as the &#x201c;black press&#x201d; in that era: Jet, Ebony, Black World (n� Negro Digest), and Players (a black version of Playboy), all of which culminated in 1970 when I was twenty-two years old with an early PBS drawing show, Charlie&#x2019;s Pad, that I created, hosted, and co-produced.<br> <br>After that early, exhaustive seven-year career, I was ready to start writing fiction full-time. To tell stories with words and not just visual images.</p><h2>Scriptures for Faith, Deliverance, and Healing: A Topical Guide to Spiritual and Personal Growth (Topical Scripture Series)</h2><p><b>Pray and Believe the Word</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Healing and deliverance are the two most central parts of your salvation experience.

She has won many gold medals and prizes for her work as a photographer and filmmaker. Her books for children are known and loved throughout the world.</p>Ages 3-5. Renowned photographer Hoban specializes in making concepts like size, color, and symbols come alive for young children. This book highlights shapes that may be difficult to grasp in the abstract, but are found everywhere. The book jacket, featuring a boy and girl playing in front of a garage, is a perfect setup for the subject: the scene contains many of the shapes introduced in the book, illustrating how they infiltrate daily life. Hoban identifies each shape before setting out on a wordless photo exploration. The pictures are a delight, showing shapes in a child's daily world (alphabet blocks, ice cream cones) as well as ones a child might encounter on a trip to the city or country (traffic cones, bales of hay). There's even a gorgeous photo of a castle that brings all the shapes together. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Her work led to the landmark Title IX law requiring that girls/women and boys/men be given the same opportunity in sports, and she empowered women and educated men when she defeated Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes in 1973. Life magazine named King one of the "100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century," and she is ranked No. 5 on the Sports Illustrated "Top 40 Athletes" list for significantly altering or elevating sports the last four decades. <p>Christine Brennan is an award-winning USA Today sports columnist and the bestselling author of The Best Seat in the House: A Father, A Daughter, A Journey Through Sports, Champions on Ice, and Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey Into the Secret World of Figure Skating. She is also a commentator on ABC News, ESPN, and NPR's Morning Edition. </p><p>Award-winning actress Holly Hunter has been a friend and admirer of Billie Jean King's for many years. Hunter also starred as Billie Jean in the film dramatization of the Battle of the Sexes, When Billie Beat Bobby.</p>Tennis champion King uses her 1973 Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs as a foil to illuminate 13 life lessons in this self-help quasi-memoir. Part business advice, part personal advice and all motivation, King's insights aren't novel (seize opportunities whenever they arise, do your best and visualize success), and her advice (shared family meals with all cell phones turned off) is standard but sound. For a radical figure in sports and women's equality, King treads the safe and narrow throughout the brief book (her first since the 1982 autobiography Billie Jean), and coasts on repeated references to an important but particularly dated match. Tennis fans may want to give it a perusal, but those seeking fresh inspiration can pass. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There he finds a pen pal&#x2015;Penguin.<br> <br> Giraffe knows nothing about penguins and his letters are full of questions. Where is a penguin's neck? Can a penguin fly? Penguin answers as best he can.<br> <br> But no one expects what happens when the pen pals come face to face at last.<br> <br> An enduring bestseller in its native Japan, <em>Yours Sincerely, Giraffe</em> is a funny tale of mistaken assumptions and friendship.</p></p><p><p><strong>Megumi Iwasa</strong> studied graphic design at Tama Art University in Tokyo, where she also worked.

His illustrations have been exhibited throughout the world, and he has won many major international awards.</p><p>"An extremely bored giraffe becomes curious about what lies on the other side of the horizon and recruits a pelican to be his own personal courier. The pelican, equally bored and eager for new business, offers to travel anywhere and takes Giraffe's letter far across the ocean to Whale Sea. A correspondence begins between Giraffe and a penguin. As the pen pals discover more about what it's like on the other side of the horizon, each also ends up trying to solve the mystery of what the other animal looks like. The resulting letters and antics are humorous as the giraffe and the penguin imagine what life is like on opposite parts of the globe. <strong>This Japanese import will charm beginning readers who enjoy a bit of witty humor with their animal adventures.</strong> The pen-and-ink illustrations are simple yet have a Quentin Blake feel that rounds out the characters and their quirky behaviors. <strong>A highly amusing early chapter book for readers who may also be learning the art of letter writing.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>School Library Journal</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Giraffe should be content; he has plenty to eat and a comfortable home. But he's bored and wonders what lies over the horizon. Upon seeing Pelican's sign for his new delivery service, Giraffe gets the idea to write a letter to someone on the other side. He instructs Pelican to give the letter to the first animal he sees over the horizon, and so Penguin becomes the lucky recipient of Giraffe's note, courtesy of his local messenger seal. Letters go back and forth between Giraffe and Penguin, and Giraffe grows curious about what his correspondent looks like. Hilarity ensues as Giraffe and Pelican, neither of whom has ever seen a penguin, search the missives for clues so they can dress Giraffe to look like Penguin. When at last the pen pals meet, what a surprise awaits! But who cares how they look? Through their letters, a lasting friendship has developed between the animals. The combination of short narrative, dialogue, letters, and humorous penand- ink drawings is a winning one. For children who send or receive few letters, the book's a great introduction to letter writing, although this isn't its main purpose. <strong>Its gentle friendship story will leave readers feeling warm and fuzzy, making this early chapter book a great addition to any collection.</strong>"&#x2015;starred,<em> </em><em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Giraffe, bored and looking for a friend, becomes pen pals with Penguin in this illustrated chapter book. Even though Giraffe has nice weather and plenty to eat in his home in Africa, he is bored because he doesn't have 'an extra special friend.' A notice from an also-bored pelican offering 'to deliver anything anywhere' spurs Giraffe to write a letter introducing himself ('I'm famous for my long neck'), and he asks Pelican to deliver it to the first animal he meets on the 'other side of the horizon.' After a long flight, Pelican sees Seal. Seal delivers the letter to Penguin, since Penguin is 'the only animal . . . who got letters. . . . Most were from his girlfriend.' This original, playful story unfolds with perfect pacing as Giraffe and Penguin start a pen-pal correspondence. (Penguin, not sure what a neck is, writes back: 'I think maybe I don't have a neck. Or maybe I am all neck?') Giraffe and Pelican, reading Penguin's letters describing himself, are just as confused about what Penguin looks like. Hilarious deductive reasoning ensues. Young readers will love the silliness. Older readers (including adults) will relax in this gentle, judgment-free world of curiosity and discovery.

Roberto Sirvent and Danny Haiphong cut through the monstrous and seductive idolatry, bad faith, and false historic discourses of America's &#x2018;exceptionalism&#x2019; and &#x2018;innocence.&#x2019; America is precisely exceptional in its history of white terrorism, colonial logic, and imperialist fantasies and actions; and, America&#x2019;s naked reality exudes a stench of culpability. The book that you hold is a radical counter-narrative to national and destructive common sense that is embedded within a politics of distraction. It is a text that radically forces a counter-memory, one that refuses to forget the violent myths of manifest destiny and a corrupt and toxic white philosophical anthropology that supports it. &nbsp;Roberto Sirvent and Danny Haiphong dare to imagine a radically different future, one predicated upon uncompromising justice.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;George Yancy, </b>Professor of Philosophy at Emory University &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In a damning indictment of the collapse of the American Empire and its Democratic, Republican, and corporate media overseers, Roberto Sirvent and Danny Haiphong expose the ruling class propaganda machine as it worships at the altar of austerity, war, and white supremacy.

It will help readers who are angry and scared about Trump&#x2019;s agenda connect their reactions to the broader arc of US stratification and violence, and the resistance movements we need to study, bolster, and expand right now.

If their book is indeed a dissection (or perhaps vivisection is more accurate), then Sirvent and Haiphong use multiple instruments to conduct their examination, invoking everything from Captain America&#x2019;s shield to the Broadway play &#x201c;Hamilton,&#x201d; from 9/11 to the NFL draft, immigration to the invasion of Afghanistan. But they always seem to return to Ground Zero, which is racism, generally, and anti-black racism, specifically. ... <i>American Exceptionalism</i> is a remarkable work of both scholarship and writing.

The US was built on genocide and slavery, and, accordingly, has invaded weaker countries to impose systems which protect the privileged few from the just demands of the struggling masses. The result has been vast inequality and suffering in both the US and abroad, and the undermining, if not wholesale destruction, of democracy.&nbsp; As this book show us, US Empire is the greatest threat to the survival of humanity, and it is only the citizens of the US who can, and indeed must, dismantle it.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Dan Kovalik,</b> author of <i>The Plot to Scapegoat Russia</i> and <i>The Plot to Attack Iran</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Timely, historic, and analytically rich, Roberto Sirvent and Danny Haiphong rightfully challenge the hegemonic narrative of American innocence and American exceptionalism that pervade contemporary culture. &nbsp;Examining monuments, memory, media, and movies, alongside of political slogans, sports culture and social movements, this book offers a powerful intervention, demanding that we account for the bipartisan project of hyper nationalism and narratives of America&#x2019;s unique greatness.

Instead they are all bedridden with scarlet fever. Trisha's family is one of the few who has been spared from the epidemic. It is difficult for them to enjoy their Hanukkah feast when they know that their neighbors won't be able to celebrate their holiday. Then Grampa has an inspiration: they will cut down trees, decorate them, and secretly deliver them to the neighbors, "But what can we decorate them with?" Babushka asks. Although it is a sacrifice, Trisha realizes that Grampa's carved animals are the perfect answer.

The French could keep their croissants and the Champs-�lys�es. Who cares about London? Rome? Athens? From what she&#x2019;d heard, they were just a bunch of ruins. And what of Williamsburg, Virginia? Charleston, South Carolina? New York City? As far as she was concerned, they could all fall off the map.<br> In all the world, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton thought there was no place more beautiful than Albany at springtime. Of course, the Pastures was dear to her as her childhood home, and even more so as the site of her wedding to Alexander Hamilton just last winter. Time had done little to dampen their affection, and she was more in love with her husband than ever. Perhaps it was this love that led to Eliza&#x2019;s delight at anything and everything around her.<br> But rose-colored glasses or no, it was hard to claim there was anywhere more glorious than late April in her hometown. The air was warm and the sun was mellow. Bare trees had covered themselves in soft green foliage and the sharp, tangy smell of fireplace smoke gave way to the softer aromas of hyacinths and crocuses, lilac and dogwood. Swallows darted through the air, snapping up flies and gnats, and newborn calves, foals, and shoats frolicked about the fields and sties. The mighty Hudson River was wreathed in mist at daybreak and teemed with fishermen&#x2019;s boats in the afternoon. Their nets hauled in plentiful catches of shad, whose roe had a delicate, almost nutty taste that paired perfectly with a salad of tender mustard greens.<br> But best of all was the bounty of blueberries and strawberries. All over the estate, hundreds of bushes sagged beneath the weight of thousands upon thousands of red, burgundy, and purple fruit. Every morning for a week, Eliza and her sisters, Angelica, Peggy, and five-year-old Cornelia&#x2014;joined sometimes by their youngest brother, eight-year-old Rensselaer, known affectionately as Ren&#x2014;traded in their sumptuous silks and bustles for simple, sturdy muslin skirts that they&#x2019;d tie up high, showing ankles and calves in a bit of a risqu� manner, and joined the housemaids in the fields to pick bucket after bucket of plump, sweet, juicy berries. (Well, not Ren. Ren hadn&#x2019;t worn a skirt since his christening.)<br> By noon, their lips were as stained as their fingertips (after all, picking involved a fair bit of &#x201c;sampling,&#x201d; as Eliza put it), and the three oldest sisters repaired to the kitchen to do their work. Some of the fruit was packed in ice in the cellar, and some more was baked into pies, but most was simmered in rich syrupy jellies whose tart sweetness would liven up many a winter meal, slathered on fresh bread or griddle cakes or dabbed on turkey or mutton. A portion of the fruit was pickled, making for a delicious snack, salty at first, before exploding in your mouth in a burst of sweetness.<br> But as tempting as all these rich cooked treats were, Eliza&#x2019;s favorite way to eat them was also the simplest: fresh and chilled. Each plump fruit tasted like a thimble-size dollop of liquid happiness. That early spring afternoon, standing in the dappled light by the stone counter, Eliza alternated between a basket of strawberries and a basket of blueberries, savoring them one at a time.<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t decide which is more perfect!&#x201d; she exclaimed to her sisters, who were gathered around the long rustic table that ran down the center of the kitchen, sorting fruit.<br> &#x201c;Blech.&#x201d; Peggy Schuyler pouted with lips that were nearly as fruit-stained as Eliza&#x2019;s. &#x201c;If I ever see another strawberry or blueberry again, it will be too soon!&#x201d; she said as she reached for yet another blueberry and popped it in her mouth.<br> &#x201c;Peg&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Angelica agreed. &#x201c;Sometimes nature&#x2019;s bounty is too much. A week ago I couldn&#x2019;t wait for the fruit to ripen. Now all I want are peanuts! What I wouldn&#x2019;t give for freshly roasted nuts right now!&#x201d; But before the words had escaped her lips, she was already rolling a red strawberry between her fingers, letting it disappear into her mouth as well.<br> &#x201c;With this war, we can&#x2019;t have peanuts till September anyway,&#x201d; said Eliza.<br> &#x201c;Stephen says the war may be over before fall,&#x201d; said Peggy, referring to her fianc�, Stephen Van Rensselaer III. &#x201c;The American coastline is simply too long for even an army or navy as powerful as England&#x2019;s to cover, and with French forces now fully committed to the cause of our independence, King George&#x2019;s men will find themselves both outnumbered and outmaneuvered.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It is hard to imagine this war being over,&#x201d; Eliza said. &#x201c;I feel as though we have grown up with it. But I do hope he&#x2019;s right! Alex and I have been married for half a year already, but we have yet to establish a household.&#x201d;<br> Indeed, as much as Eliza loved the Pastures, she was impatient to move out of her parents&#x2019; house and into one with her husband. After their wedding, they&#x2019;d only had a few blessed weeks together before he had to rush back to General Washington&#x2019;s headquarters. These days, Alex was chafing at their present living arrangements just as much as she was, and both were eager for more time on their own.<br> Though she loved her husband dearly, and knew he loved her, they had spent more time apart than together during the course of their brief romance and even briefer marriage. The flame that burned between them was bright, but they had yet to live alone as husband and wife. In many ways Alex was still a stranger to her. Their lives were mediated by family and servants and soldiers, and as such, their private lives were not as private as they would have preferred.<br> At least he&#x2019;d been home now for a spell, although he was scheduled to leave again in a few days. Missing him was the lot of a soldier&#x2019;s wife, and instead of weeping and worrying, Eliza endeavored to be brave. Still, it was difficult, even in the midst of so much beauty, not to feel bereft. When Alex was gone, she felt his absence as a physical ache. She chided herself for being so selfish. While she was his wife, he was a man of the world, of the state, and she owed it to her country to share, didn&#x2019;t she?<br> Her own parents had endured many long separations during their marriage. Even so, General and Mrs. Schuyler had at least had a few years to establish themselves and start their family before their first parting.<br> Since Alex was leaving soon to report back to duty, festivities had been planned for later that evening. She didn&#x2019;t want to surmise how long he&#x2019;d be gone, but hoped when he returned they would finally be able to settle down on their own. &#x201c;I am ready to live under my own roof,&#x201d; Eliza declared.<br> &#x201c;Hear, hear,&#x201d; Angelica seconded. &#x201c;I have been married a year longer than you, and my husband and I see less of each other than when we were courting. Tell me: Do you know yet where he plans to make his residence?&#x201d;<br> Eliza shook her head. &#x201c;It will probably be New York City, which is most conducive to a career in law. But if he is lured into politics, we may well end up in Philadelphia or perhaps someplace farther south, if all this talk of creating a capital in the midpoint of the country comes to pass.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;<i>Uuuuuugh.</i>&#x201d; The sisters&#x2019; conversation was interrupted by a low moan from a corner of the kitchen, where Cornelia was sprawled across a stack of burlap bags filled with rice. Her face from nose to chin to plump cheeks was painted dark purple from greedily consumed berries. &#x201c;Too&#x2014;much&#x2014;fruit.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I told you, Cornelia,&#x201d; Eliza said, laughing in sympathy. &#x201c;You must pace yourself or you&#x2019;ll give yourself a bellyache.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Too&#x2014;late,&#x201d; Cornelia moaned, rubbing her aproned stomach with fingers that were as dark as her mouth. But even as she did, she sat up and was soon shuffling toward the buckets brimming with fruit.<br> &#x201c;Wait till tea, dear, and you can have scones with fresh jam and cream,&#x201d; Eliza said, catching her sister and turning her around. &#x201c;Please head inside now and have Dot give you a good scrub. We can&#x2019;t have you looking like a harlequin at the party tonight.&#x201d;<br> Eliza expected Cornelia to protest being handed over to their ladies&#x2019; maid. Instead, a piercing scream filled the sweet-scented kitchen. &#x201c;Party!&#x201d; the little girl screeched gleefully, running toward the door. &#x201c;Dot! Dot!&#x201d; she could be heard yelling as she disappeared into the courtyard. &#x201c;Eliza says you must give me a bath RIGHT NOW!&#x201d;<br> Eliza stared fondly after her youngest sister, then returned to Angelica and Peggy. Just two and a half years separated all three older girls. Though quite distinct in appearance, they were nevertheless so close that they were often referred to collectively as &#x201c;the Schuyler sisters,&#x201d; as if they were triplets.<br> &#x201c;Speaking of husbands: Will Mr. Church will be joining us this evening as well?&#x201d; she asked Angelica.<br> &#x201c;Oh, Eliza, don&#x2019;t be so stuffy! We have been married for ages, you can call him John!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; Peggy laughed. &#x201c;I heard her talking to her husband the other day. Do you know she still calls him Colonel Hamilton in public?!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Peggy!&#x201d; Eliza exclaimed. &#x201c;You ought not to eavesdrop.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not eavesdropping when all three of us are in the same parlor,&#x201d; Peggy said with a smirk. &#x201c;Tell me, sister dear. Do you <i>always</i> address your husband so formally? I hope there are times when your discourse is more . . . intimate!&#x201d;<br> Eliza felt a deep blush color her throat and cheeks. She did call him Alex when they were alone, but in public, she followed her mother&#x2019;s model and addressed him by his proper title. Fortunately, the hot kitchen was filled with steam from pots of stew and consomm� for the party, and she hoped her sisters wouldn&#x2019;t notice. Still, she found herself helplessly tongue-tied.<br> &#x201c;Oh, Peggy,&#x201d; Angelica said. &#x201c;Always the provocateur!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Peggy laughed. &#x201c;I am but an unmarried maiden, whereas you two are worldly wedded women. How could I possibly provoke <i>you</i>?&#x201d;<br> Angelica couldn&#x2019;t help but grin. &#x201c;I suspect that our polite Eliza will continue to address him as Colonel Hamilton among company even when they have been married as long as Mama and Papa.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Unless he gets promoted like Papa,&#x201d; Eliza said, finally finding her voice. &#x201c;In which case, I&#x2019;ll call him <i>General</i> Hamilton. And you never answered my question. Will John be joining us this evening?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I believe so. He accompanied your colonel and Papa when they went into town this morning to attend to some work of his own, and told me he expects to finish by early evening. And Stephen?&#x201d; Angelica continued, turning to Peggy. &#x201c;Will your young man be there as well?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;He said he is bringing half the Rensselaer cousins with him,&#x201d; Peggy replied with a nod, though she didn&#x2019;t sound happy about it.<br> &#x201c;Is Mother Rensselaer still refusing to allow him to propose?&#x201d; Eliza asked.<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid so.&#x201d; Peggy sighed. &#x201c;She says he is too young, but I don&#x2019;t believe it. When we first began courting, she was eager for us to marry immediately, but after what happened with Papa, she grew noticeably less enthusiastic. It&#x2019;s almost as if she thinks I am after him for his money!&#x201d;<br> It was true that the Schuyler fortune wasn&#x2019;t what it once was. Four years ago, General Schuyler had been unceremoniously replaced by Horatio Gates as commander of the northern army, at about the same time that the Schuylers&#x2019; Saratoga country estate was burned to the ground by British forces, destroying the better part of the Schuylers&#x2019; income. Between the loss of funds and the cost of rebuilding, it had been a lean couple of years. But the family coffers had begun to recover at last, especially after Angelica&#x2019;s and Eliza&#x2019;s marriages. John Barker Church, Angelica&#x2019;s husband, had a booming business in trade, and Alexander Hamilton, though far from rich, was well provided for by the Continental army, and everyone said he had a bright, indeed limitless, future ahead of him. <br> Alas, that did not seem enough for the snooty Rensselaers. <br> &#x201c;She is being absurd!&#x201d; Eliza scoffed now. &#x201c;It is <i>Stephen</i> who chased <i>you</i>. Why, that boy has been in love with you since he was in short pants!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh, has he started wearing trousers at last?&#x201d; Angelica quipped, to a swat from Peggy.<br> Eliza laughed, then patted her younger sister&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;The Rensselaers wouldn&#x2019;t dare forever object to joining their family with ours. We are already cousins on Mama&#x2019;s side, and for all their money and land, they haven&#x2019;t nearly the prestige we do.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;Well, it sounds like dinner will be a full house. I look forward to seeing all three of our lads in the same room. It&#x2019;s so rare these days.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I know!&#x201d; Angelica said. &#x201c;And soon enough the war will be over and you will be moving to New York City or Philadelphia or, heaven forbid, Virginia. John has been talking about returning to England, and I&#x2019;m sure Stephen will want to build Peggy a house on some plantation-size corner of his vast holdings. This may be the last time we&#x2019;re all together for who knows how long!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well then, let&#x2019;s make it the best party ever!&#x201d; Eliza said. She stood up and grabbed a pie from the cooling rack, placing it in a basket. &#x201c;And now if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I&#x2019;m going to take Mama a snack. Peggy, please don&#x2019;t wear the crimson silk Stephen gave you,&#x201d; she joked. &#x201c;I cannot bear to be eclipsed by your radiance yet again.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; Angelica laughed. &#x201c;Telling Peggy not to dress up is like telling a goldfinch not to shine. Face it, Eliza, you&#x2019;re going to have to cinch tonight.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And put on a wig!&#x201d; Peggy added with a laugh. &#x201c;Dot was teasing mine up for an hour last night, and it is <i>at least </i>three feet high!&#x201d;<br> Eliza groaned, dreading the pinch of a corset and the itchiness of a wig, then reached for one last berry.<br> Springtime! In Albany! Not even the thought of all the painstaking effort that would go into looking presentable could ruin her day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>2</b><br> <b>Allies and Conspirators</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Schuylkill Tavern</i><br> <i>Albany, New York </i><br> <i>April 1781</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Colonel Alexander Hamilton leaned against the nearby open window and drew in a few deep breaths. Both his father-in-law, General Philip Schuyler, and his brother-in- law, John Barker Church, were inveterate smokers, and after four hours, the small room in the back of Schuylkill Tavern was suffused with smoke. He desperately needed some fresh air. Yet the atmosphere outside was hardly more pleasant than that in the room. The tavern&#x2019;s back side (all puns intended) opened onto a narrow, muddy alley into which the local innkeepers regularly tossed their garbage and scraps, not to mention the contents of their guests&#x2019; chamber pots. But as long as Alex inhaled through his mouth rather than his nose, he was all right. At any rate, he was at least not tempted to retch.<br> He scolded himself for complaining, for surely the price of inhaling a little smoke was nothing compared to now being part of Eliza&#x2019;s family&#x2014;the Schuylers were one of the oldest and most prestigious clans in all of New York to be sure&#x2014;but more important, Alex had been folded right into the middle of its loving arms. The family was even throwing him a good-bye party tonight before his imminent return to duty. Speaking of loving, the last six months had been the very definition of wedded bliss, as yearning for Eliza from afar did not hold a candle to the very happy reality of being her husband.

Foster clarifies the prayer process, answers common misconceptions, and shows the way into prayers of contemplation, healing, blessing, forgiveness, and rest.</p><p>This accessible, rich, and reliable guide shows how each of the various forms of payer can move us inward into personal transformation, upward toward intimacy with God, and outward to minister to others. <em>Prayer: Finding the Heart's True Home</em> has won numerous honors including <em>Christianity Today's</em> Book of the Year and the Evangelical Christian Publishers' Association Gold Medallion Award.</p><p>Read by Terence Aselford</p></p><p>There are hundreds of books on prayer, and much of the advice they contain is likely to be the same. So what distinguishes these books? Call it a kind of wisdom, a sense that here's someone who knows something of God's heart. A good example can be found in this fine book by the Quaker writer and teacher Richard Foster. The author of the bestselling <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> explores various aspects of prayer, which he defines in one place as "the human response to the perpetual outpouring of love by which God lays siege to every soul." Beginning with the simplest forms of prayer--what he calls "ordinary people bringing ... ordinary concerns to a loving and compassionate Father"--he then explores the deeper places where prayer becomes not simply petition but a way of life. He writes of prayer of adoration and rest, sacramental prayer, meditation, and contemplation, and in the final section of the book moves outward into ministry, where prayer meets the needs of the world. In each chapter Foster defines, describes, and gives helpful examples. Above all he writes with grace--in both the artistic and spiritual senses. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>"The truth of the matter is, we all come to prayer with a tangled mass of motives--altruistic <i>and</i> selfish, merciful <i>and</i> hateful, loving <i>and</i> bitter. Frankly, this side of eternity we will <i>never</i> unravel the good from the bad, the pure from the impure. But what I have come to see is that God is big enough to receive us with all our mixture. We do not have to be bright, or pure, or filled with faith, or anything. That is what grace means, and not only are we saved by grace, we live by it as well. And we pray by it."--Richard J. Foster, from <i>Prayer: Finding the Hearts True Home. <p>Bestselling author Richard J. Foster offers a warm, compelling, and sensitive primer on prayer, helping us to understand, experience, and practice it in its many forms--from the simple prayer of beginning again to unceasing prayer. He clarifies the prayer process, answers common misconceptions, and shows the way into prayers of contemplation, healing, blessing, forgiveness, and rest. </p><p>Coming to prayer is like coming home, Foster says. "Nothing feels more right, more like what we are created to be and to do. Yet at the same time we are confronted with great mysteries. Who hasn't struggled with the puzzle of unanswered prayer? Who hasn't wondered how a finite person can commune with the infinite Creator of the universe? Who hasn't questioned whether prayer isn't merely psychological manipulation after all? We do our best, of course, to answer these knotty questions but when all is said and done, there is a sense in which these mysteries remain unanswered and unanswerable... At such times we must learn to become comfortable with the mystery." </p><p>Foster shows how prayer can move us inward into personal transformation, upward toward intimacy with God, and outward to minister to others. He leads us beyond questions to a deeper understanding and practice of prayer, bringing us closer to God, to ourselves, and to our community.</p></i></p><h2>ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R)</h2><p>This new edition to the classic book by ggplot2 creator Hadley Wickham highlights compatibility with knitr and RStudio. ggplot2 is a data visualization package for R that helps users create data graphics, including those that are multi-layered, with ease.

Feynman himself, however, insisted that the notes were not a record but the work itself. In <em>Supersizing the Mind</em> , Andy Clark argues that our thinking doesn't happen only in our heads but that "certain forms of human cognizing include inextricable tangles of feedback, feed-forward and feed-around loops: loops that promiscuously criss-cross the boundaries of brain, body and world." The pen and paper of Feynman's thought are just such feedback loops, physical machinery that shape the flow of thought and enlarge the boundaries of mind. Drawing upon recent work in psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, human-computer systems, and beyond, Supersizing the Mind offers both a tour of the emerging cognitive landscape and a sustained argument in favor of a conception of mind that is extended rather than "brain-bound." The importance of this new perspective is profound. If our minds themselves can include aspects of our social and physical environments, then the kinds of social and physical environments we create can reconfigure our minds and our capacity for thought and reason.<br></p><p><br><strong>Andy Clark</strong> is Professor of Philosophy, Edinburgh University.

It turns out that there&#x2019;s a mole within their close-working group (thus the title), so off they go to Yale University (and beyond) to follow clues and get to the bottom of things. After one of their suspects pronounces that the brother-sister team doesn&#x2019;t know a &#x201c;rat&#x2019;s ass&#x201d; about loyalty, things get mildly violent, with a few gunshots; then tricky, with a couple boyfriend/girlfriend issues; and then dramatic, with some hostage-release attempts. All of these elements help to make this series popular beyond those interested in the more cerebral components, such as Ivy League medievalists and rare manuscripts. The corresponding online game and accompanying game cards (in the non-library edition) don&#x2019;t hurt popularity either, and fans will be carried right along with a few answers and quite a cliffhanger until a different author produces the next volume.

The past hour had been pure bedlam&#x2014;guests hysterical and screaming, she herself completely baffled.<br><br>Of course she had offered to refund everyone's money and suggest a beautiful chain hotel for them to check into.<br><br>She opened her mouth, not to scream, but to call out for immediate attention. Because she couldn't think of anything else that might have happened except that one of her permanent residents had played a not-very-funny trick on her unsuspecting guests.<br><br>Melody Chandler was already there, leaning against the refrigerator in her beautiful Victorian glory, staring at her.<br><br>"What the hell was that?" Hannah demanded. "Did you bring a friend in? A dying man with his throat slit, carrying a knife and trying to kill my guests?"<br><br>"No!" Melody protested.<br><br>"That was unbelievable. I've never had guests up and leave at 4:00 a.m. before. Never. And I've never had to refund anyone's money before, either." Angrily, Hannah crossed her arms over her chest and stared at the ghost with whom she had shared this house for as long as she could remember. The original owner had been Hannah's great-great-great grandfather on her father's side, but she had actually inherited the house, already a B and B at that point, from her uncle. She had been his favorite niece, and she had loved him and the house. Sadly, he had died in his late forties from a sudden heart attack, and she had inherited the Siren all too soon. He had known how much she loved the place. She'd spent much of her time there with him, since her parents&#x2014;who had lived a few blocks away on Simonton Street&#x2014;had both worked.<br><br>She knew the house backward and forward&#x2014;along with its ghosts.<br><br>She fought to control her temper. "Melody, a little spooking the guests is fun, but this time you and Hagen went too far. I'm fighting to keep this place, but I can't do that if I don't make a profit. You two just scared all our weekend guests away. And Shelly, the poor girl who saw you, was beyond terrified. And from what she described, I don't blame her."<br><br>"You did not listen to me, Hannah," Melody protested, staring at her with wide eyes, pleading to be believed. "We did not do it. Hagen would never do anything like that. You know how squeamish he can be. And look at me. Do I look like a bleeding man with a knife? And who do I know? The same spirits you do! I do not know of a single spirit walking around Key West with a bleeding neck and a knife in his hand."<br><br>Melody and Hagen didn't refer to themselves as ghosts and didn't like to be referred to that way.<br><br>Of course, tourists and most locals called the city's haunts ghosts, but Hannah was usually careful and polite, following their wishes and calling them spirits within their hearing.<br><br>And with her temper cooling, now that the brouhaha in the house had died down, she had to admit that she really couldn't picture her resident ghosts turning themselves into the terrifying apparition described by her now-gone hysterical guests. But if her two known household entities hadn't been playing tricks...<br><br>"Then who...?" she asked.<br><br>Someone drifted in through the closed back door and then materialized into an excellent imitation of flesh and blood.<br><br>Hannah was accustomed to such comings and goings. Hagen Dundee entered the kitchen and took up a protective stance at Melody's side, slipping a ghostly arm around her. "I heard, Hannah, and Melody is telling you the truth, I swear it. As if anyone could ever mistake her for a man! And I promise you that it was not me, either. We were not even here. We were at the Hemingway House, playing with the cats."<br><br>"Torturing the poor little six-toed creatures, probably," Hannah said, still angry. She'd lost business tonight, business she couldn't afford to lose. And she was fighting to believe it had been someone's idea of a prank; it was too frightening to think that it might be something else. Something real.<br><br>"I love cats. I would never torture cats. You know that I love all animals," Melody said regally.<br><br>Hannah swallowed, then pursued the hope that perhaps the couple had schemed with one of their island spirit friends to scare tourists.<br><br>"Honestly," she said, "we've talked about this before. It's charming and wonderful and <em>helps</em> business when you guys fool around and moan and groan in the middle of the night. Or, Melody, when you make an appearance at dusk, pacing the roof. Or, Hagen, when someone opens a door in the middle of the night and you're standing in the hallway, looking tall and strong and desperate to find your beloved. But what happened tonight...it was mean. One of those people could have had a heart attack."<br><br>Hagen looked at Melody and then walked over to Hannah and set his hands on his hips. His sandy hair was worn in a queue, and his bleached cotton shirt seemed to billow around his broad shoulders. She could have sworn she even saw specks of mud on his black leather boots. "Hannah," he said earnestly, "we did not do it." Then he turned his back on her and addressed Melody. "Dear, I believe we need fresh air&#x2014;and different company. Shall we go for a bit of a walk?"<br><br>She stepped forward and took his arm. Then, heads held high, they headed toward the back door.<br><br>"Wait!" Hannah said. "Please. Help me. If you guys didn't do it...who could it have been?"<br><br>"This island has spirits&#x2014;and spirits," Hagen told her. "Most of your ghost tourists stay on at the Hard Rock when you are done talking, and maybe they imbibed too heavily of spirits of an alcoholic nature. What I do know is that we did not do it&#x2014;and you have deeply insulted us by suggesting we would do something so horrible. I really cannot stand here discussing this any further, Hannah. I am sorry. Melody, shall we take our stroll now? Perhaps down to the beach?" he asked, then bowed in a courtly manner and moved as if he were really opening the door for Melody. She sailed out, and he looked at Hannah again then strode off in Melody's wake.<br><br>Hannah watched them go, surprised&#x2014;and more than a little shaken.<br><br>She'd grown up in this house with the two of them for company. Nothing like tonight's events had ever occurred before. She couldn't believe they would do anything so vile, but if not them... She didn't even want to think that a murderous ghost might be stalking the streets of the city she called home.<br><br>She sank down on a chair at the kitchen table, exhausted. She'd been sound asleep when she'd been startled awake, stunned and terrified herself, by the sound of screams. And Melody and Hagen were right. They didn't begin to resemble the knife-wielding apparition that had threatened her guests out by the pool.<br><br>She winced. It hurt to lose so much business. Weekdays in the Keys were slow this time of year. The Siren of the Sea wasn't a major hotel to be found on every travel site on the web, though she did have a great website of her own. During Fantasy Fest and other Conch holidays, she had it made. And she had wonderful reviews on the sites where she could be found. It was still hard to make ends meet, though. She didn't want to overprice, but she only had six guest rooms.<br><br>Her house was worth a small fortune&#x2014;she knew that. She'd received enough offers for it. But she didn't want to sell&#x2014;there was certainly nothing else in the area she could afford if she sold, and Key West was her home. She'd seen a fair amount of the world, many wonderful places, but she loved Key West.<br><br>"So..." she murmured aloud, drumming her fingers on the table.<br><br>Petrie, her humongous, long-haired, six-toed "Hemingway cat," leaped smoothly up into her lap and meowed as if in deep sympathy.<br><br>"What's going on, big guy? You're a cat&#x2014;you're supposed to sense things."<br><br>He merely swished his furry tail.<br><br>Hannah stood, gently sliding Petrie to the floor, and poured herself another cup of coffee before giving the cat a few treats.<br><br>It had all happened so fast. She had heard the screams and shot downstairs to see what was going on. Everyone in the place had been out by the pool within minutes, one college boy wielding a dive knife and Mr. Hardwicke, an elderly regular along with his wife, a heavy boot. But there had been no one there other than Shelly and Stuart, both of them hysterical. Their friends had been less than kind, insisting she'd freaked out over the ghost tour, that was all. But Stuart had been adamant that there had been a ghost&#x2014;a vengeful ghost&#x2014;and only their screams had driven him away. Someone had suggested they call the cops; someone else had snorted and said that cops couldn't arrest ghosts.<br><br>The next thing Hannah knew, they were all leaving. And while they'd spent most of the night, she'd decided it would be bad customer service practice not to refund their money.<br><br>Now the sun had risen on another beautiful Key West morning. Bright and early, just about 7:00 a.m., a westward breeze was coming in, the foliage was moving gently in the breeze, and the dead heat of midday was not yet burning the pavement.<br><br>She went to right one of her Victorian lawn lounges, which had toppled over in the commotion.<br><br>And that was when she saw them.<br><br>Drops of red that led off through the bushes and...<br><br>Disappeared.<br><br>She hunkered down to study the spots and froze.<br><br>They were blood. Real blood. Not astral blood, spiritual blood, ghostly blood or imaginary blood from an apparition of some kind. Real blood meant that someone or something living had come through the yard&#x2014;not a ghost. There were outside lights by the pool, but at night these drops would have been invisible.<br><br>Hannah pushed her way through the foliage where the blood trail seemed to end, though the drops might have disappeared into thin air or they might have been soaked up by the dirt. She couldn't really tell. The yard here in back of the pool grew rich and lush all the way up to the bushes that lined the brick wall and the white wooden gate that led to the small alley behind her house. Vehicles couldn't traverse the narrow way; it was a footpath, normally used only by those who already knew it was there.<br><br>The gate was unhooked. There was a bloody handprint on it.<br><br>Gingerly, afraid of what she would find, Hannah pushed it all the way open.<br><br>And there he was. A man lying just two feet from the gate, sprawled faceup, staring wide-eyed up at the sun.<br><br>A brilliant crimson ribbon ran around his neck. And his fingers curled as if he had been holding something....<br><br>Like the hilt of a knife.<br><br>"How did you know there was a body in the alley?" Dallas Samson asked, after introducing himself and flashing his FBI badge.<br><br>The young woman who had summoned the police was standing behind the crime scene tape that now stretched across the alley and up to her gate. Detective Liam Beckett was with her. Beckett was a city cop&#x2014;and a friend of Dallas's. Apparently Beckett was a friend of the young woman's, too. She was extremely attractive, Dallas noted almost dispassionately. He filed away everything he noticed about possible suspects and witnesses in the back of his mind, so it was second nature to make a physical assessment. She was about five-five, maybe a hundred and twenty pounds, sleek and slim, with deep blue-green eyes and a mane of golden hair. She was, however, tense. She stood straight&#x2014;almost frozen. Not panicked, but icy. Almost as if she were battling not to show any emotion, doing everything in her power to remain stoic and calm. He realized he'd barely taken his eyes off her. And the tension he was feeling himself was making him come off like a drill sergeant. He couldn't help it&#x2014;not with a dead body lying in the alley and her standing there not answering his question.<br><br>He sure as hell wasn't helping her any, but it rankled that she'd been talking easily with Liam when Dallas had arrived, and now she was just staring at him without saying a word.<br><br>Her brows hiked up as she finally considered her reply to his query.<br><br>She was taking too long to answer. The tension he was feeling increased.<br><br>He pursued his question even more impatiently. "Let me rephrase. Do you usually wake up bright and early and come out to the alley looking for bodies?"<br><br>Liam cleared his throat reprovingly, and Dallas winced inwardly. He'd let his temper get the best of him, making him rude and sarcastic. He wasn't usually that way, but he was feeling a hell of a lot more tense than the blonde&#x2014;than any of them, at the moment.<br><br>But, then, he'd known the dead man. And he didn't like the way the man had been found.<br><br>"Hannah called me immediately," Liam said, frowning. "And, I assure you, it's the first time she's ever called me about a body."<br><br>"Of course," Dallas said. "Sorry. So, you knew he was here because&#x2014;" he paused, looking at Liam "&#x2014;because he was in your yard&#x2014;and still alive&#x2014;last night?" He realized the implication that she might have saved him was in his voice. He hadn't meant it to be, but that didn't mean it wasn't true.<br><br>He looked around and noticed that there was a lot of confusion at the scene. A couple of uniformed officers had been first on the scene, followed by Liam&#x2014;and he'd been right behind. Now techs were dusting and setting out numbers by everything they found, and looking for evidence, and the medical examiner was with the body. She had touched the body, trying to see what she could do for him before realizing he was dead. If she'd been a screaming basket case, he would probably be having an easier time dealing with her. But though she was calm now, she had been screaming when she'd dialed 911. The uniformed officers had probably arrived within seconds&#x2014;they were just down the street from Duval, because the department always patrolled the bar and club scene there, no matter how late&#x2014;or early&#x2014;that was.<br><br>"I never saw him in my yard. Two of my guests&#x2014;former guests&#x2014;saw him. But they didn't realize he was real. They thought they were seeing a ghost."<br><br>The young woman&#x2014;Liam had introduced her as Hannah O'Brien&#x2014;seemed to be growing aggravated with him. He didn't really blame her. He was usually a lot better at a crime scene.<br><br>"They thought a real man&#x2014;mortally injured and bleeding&#x2014;was a ghost?" Dallas demanded.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"How the hell.?" he muttered.<br><br>"I can't read their minds," she said sharply. There was something almost regal about her. Maybe that was what bugged him. It compelled him, and that irritated him. He took a breath and tried to regain a professional calm.<br><br>"All right. Can you start at the beginning for me?" he asked.<br><br>"I was sound asleep. I heard a scream and came running downstairs&#x2014;they were in back of the house by the pool. I looked out and saw two of my guests. One of them was insisting she'd seen a ghost in my yard," Hannah explained. "She&#x2014;her name's Shelly Nicholson&#x2014;had been on my ghost tour. She and her boyfriend, Stuart Bell, were absolutely convinced they'd seen a homicidal ghost. But there was nothing there.<br><br>"I tried to calm them down. I told them...I told them that ghosts weren't real, and even if they were, it wasn't likely they'd be able to kill anyone. I got them to quit screaming and talk it through. Nothing budged them. They insisted they'd seen a...</p><h2>A Tap on the Window: A Thriller</h2><p><b>One of the&nbsp;<i>Boston Globe</i>'s Best Crime Novels of the Year!<br>One of <i>Suspense Magazine</i>'s Best Books of 2013! </b><br><br>Since private investigator Cal Weaver&#x2019;s teenage son died in a tragic accident, Cal and his wife have drifted apart. Cal is mired in a grief he can&#x2019;t move past. And maybe his grief has clouded his judgment.<br><br>Driving home one night, a rain-drenched girl taps on his car window and asks for a ride. He knows a grown man picking up a teenage hitchhiker is foolish&#x2014;but he lets her in. Cal soon senses that something&#x2019;s not right with the girl or the situation. But it&#x2019;s too late. He&#x2019;s already involved.<br><br>Drawn into a nightmare of secrets, lies, and cover-ups in his small, upstate New York town, Cal knows that the only thing that can save him is the truth. And he&#x2019;s about to expose the town&#x2019;s secrets one by one&#x2014;if he lives long enough.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Linwood Barclay </b>is the #1 international bestselling author of eleven critically acclaimed novels, including <i>Trust Your Eyes</i>, which has been optioned for film, <i>Never Look Away</i>, which has been optioned for television, and <i>No Time for Goodbye</i>.When Cal Weaver spots hitchhiking teenager Claire Saunders, his instincts scream that he should just get her a cab, but Claire&#x2019;s vulnerability nudges the private investigator&#x2019;s grief over his son&#x2019;s recent death, and he offers to drive her home. In those few moments of Cals grief-clouded judgment, Claire makes Cal an unwitting instrument in her intricate plot to disappear. The next day, Claire&#x2019;s best friend, Hanna, is found murdered after disguising herself as Claire to provide diversion for Claires escape. When police target Cal for Hanna&#x2019;s murder, he knows that finding Claire and discovering why she ran is the only way to keep them both safe. The most obvious lead is the feud between the town&#x2019;s mayor, who is Claire&#x2019;s father, and the police chief over accusations of police brutality, but Cal feels he&#x2019;s missing something. The characters and small-town New York setting are vividly rendered, and that credibility shifts this thriller&#x2019;s premise from far-fetched to plausibly weird. Another success for Barclay, with unfettered storytelling, rapid pacing, and sympathetic characters primed to please hordes of eager summer readers. --Christine Tran</p><h2>Thelonious Monk Fake Book: C Edition (Fake Books)</h2><p>(Artist Books).

They lead the lives of the impoverished, grade the exams of the whiny, and spend lonely nights in the library or laboratory pursuing a glowing truth that only six or seven people will ever care about. These people are grad students, and they are idiots. <br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>This book is for readers considering or already committed to spending the best years of their lives without sunlight.

A foreword <i>and</i> a preface?<br>&nbsp;<br>Indeed.&nbsp; The existence of both sections can teach you a lot about grad school:<br>&nbsp;<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much can be gained by stretching a small amount of content over multiple pages.<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, such redundancy imparts powerful messages that are powerful.<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your reaction reveals whether you should be a grad student:<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those unfit for grad school have skipped ahead, probably to a page with an illustration.<br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who belong in grad school feel a compulsion to read every word (and, in some cases, take notes to prepare an extensive critique on the book&#x2019;s use of dialectic assonance).<br><br><b>Prologue</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>All right, now this is just insane.&nbsp; A prologue?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Are we stuck here in limbo, doomed never to begin the book?<br>&nbsp;<br>Exactly.&nbsp; Now you&#x2019;re getting it.&nbsp; This book is like your life, and the prologue is grad school.&nbsp; You eagerly want to begin your life, but grad school stands in the way, and just when you think it&#x2019;s over&#x2014;nope!&nbsp; Another section.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the hell of it is, you could begin your life this moment.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; You could skip to Chapter 1 and begin reading the actual book.&nbsp; But out of obligation to the printed word, or out of inertia, or out of a misguided need to finish what you start, you&#x2019;ll keep reading and waiting.<br>&nbsp;<br>A foreword, a preface, <i>and</i> a prologue.&nbsp; Ridiculous.&nbsp; I mean, seriously, what&#x2019;s next&#x2014;an introduction?<br><br><b>Introduction</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Every speech at my college graduation buzzed with a sense of finality.&nbsp; &#x201c;You have completed your education,&#x201d; each one reminded us.&nbsp; &#x201c;Now go contribute to society!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And most of my classmates eagerly accepted the challenge, having known that this day&#x2014;the official, robe-clad end of the beginning&#x2014;would someday arrive.&nbsp; As they pocketed their diplomas, they envisioned their new jobs, their new responsibilities, their lives outside the academy.&nbsp; They entered college as children, but they exited on that hot June afternoon as citizens of the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most of them.&nbsp; Not me.<br>&nbsp;<br>And not all of my classmates, either.&nbsp; As guest speakers and valedictorians exhorted us to go forth into the real world, a few of us felt the directive a bit premature.&nbsp; We knew that college had ended, but we also knew that the &#x201c;real&#x201d; world was years away.&nbsp; We were prepared instead to enter a half-assed compromise between college and real life, a simultaneously intense and lackadaisical academic perdition called &#x201c;grad school.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>I felt a little like a cheater, like a twelve-year old who still wades in the kiddie pool, knowing it&#x2019;s well past time to start swimming, but frightened of the loud teenagers in the big pool.&nbsp; Or maybe like a budding musician who masters Guitar Hero, but never picks up an actual guitar.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Instead of a job and a boss and a mortgage, September would bring another college campus with its dorms and quads and classrooms&#x2014;and we wouldn&#x2019;t even feel like its most welcome occupants.<br>&nbsp;<br>We would walk around our new planned communities in a daze, not quite fitting in with the social culture, and not really supposed to.&nbsp; We would experience all the disorientation of a new campus&#x2014;just like we did four years ago&#x2014;but none of the excitement.&nbsp; And we&#x2019;d have no idea whether to go to football games.<br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>&nbsp;<br>I spent the first two months of grad school determining whether three amino acid residues (out of hundreds) were important for the functioning of a certain protein (out of thousands) that helps certain bacteria eat a sugar called arabinose.<br>&nbsp;<br>I demonstrated that those three residues are not important.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two months.<br>&nbsp;<br>But that&#x2019;s grad school.&nbsp; You take a tiny corner of the universe that a professor finds fascinating and bury your face in it, only looking up occasionally to steal unattended bagels.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the end of two months, I felt ready to announce my discovery to the world.&nbsp; &#x201c;Residues 103, 107, and 109 are unimportant!&#x201d; I wanted to cry from the hilltops.&nbsp; &#x201c;Unimportant!&#x201d;&nbsp; But a journal article never quite coalesced, and I moved on to a different lab, and now exactly zero people know about my discovery&#x2014;which, had I ended up publishing the results, would have been exactly the number of people who cared.<br>&nbsp;<br>What <i>was</i> this?&nbsp; My entire life, I felt I was gearing up to <i>do</i> something.&nbsp; Now I had finished my college education, and as a reward, I got to sit in an ignored corner of an academic building, growing and harvesting plate after plate of meaningless bacteria, solely for the sake of turning grant money into fodder for more grant money.<br>&nbsp;<br>To a member of the generation that was reminded, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re special!&#x201d; at every turn, nothing strikes a blow like realizing you&#x2019;ve reached adulthood positioned to be completely, maybe permanently, irrelevant.<br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>&nbsp;<br>Hence this book.&nbsp; No matter where you are in the grad school process, you&#x2019;ve probably felt this way (or will soon).<br>&nbsp;<br>Sure, you love what you study&#x2014;but to the exclusion of nearly all else?&nbsp; When you&#x2019;re typing page three of a 25-page paper at 4:00 AM, sucking down your ninth Red Bull of the night, will you honestly feel there&#x2019;s nothing you&#x2019;d rather do?&nbsp; Or will you shut your laptop in anger, thrust your head into your hands, and lament your stupid, stupid decision to go to grad school?<br>&nbsp;<br>***<br>&nbsp;<br>If there&#x2019;s one thing I&#x2019;ve learned from writing a book about grad school, it&#x2019;s that writing a book about college must be easy.&nbsp; Most college students are young, overconfident, drink beer, go to classes, take exams, write papers, party, live in dorms, deal with professors, parents, and roommates&#x2014;in other words, their experiences are relatively universal.<br>&nbsp;<br>Grad schools are all different.&nbsp; You could earn a Master&#x2019;s, a Ph.D., a J.D., an M.B.A., a D.V.M., (that&#x2019;s a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine), or one of hundreds of other degrees.&nbsp; Your daily routine could include hours of classroom instruction (either giving or receiving it), or you may never need to attend class.&nbsp; You might obligatorily spend twelve hours a day in a lab, or you might have to research your dissertation at your own pace in a location of your choosing.&nbsp; Hell, you may not even write a dissertation.&nbsp; You also might not have oral exams, teaching responsibilities, or an actual advisor.&nbsp; Your program may stop after a flat-out guaranteed two years, or you could find yourself puttering around campus a decade from now, swearing up and down that you&#x2019;re going to graduate any minute.&nbsp; You might be twenty-two years old and eager to spend the rest of your life studying particle physics, or you might be fifty, have a job and a family, and you&#x2019;ve decided to earn an M.B.A. at night online for a little salary bump.<br>&nbsp;<br>So here&#x2019;s what I don&#x2019;t want.&nbsp; I don&#x2019;t want to find my book on Amazon.com with little user reviews that say things like this:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>What the hell is a &#x201c;thesis&#x201d;?</b>, April 13, 2010 <br>By <b>Stupid Whiny Complainer</b><br>Not everything in this book applied to me!&nbsp;

Do we even have a correct Bible in English that we can trust as the Word of God? <p>This book addresses a very sensitive subject with kindness, candor, authority, and biblical support. Every page points believers to the most biblical, the most logical, and the most historically sensible position regarding the true Word of God for English-speaking people.

Although at the time he did not intend that it would ever be published, he explains, There has been a continent shift in my life which will be understood by many who have been where I am. I offer my own passage, hoping it may lift others who share the path with me, or who will one day find themselves on the same road, hoping someone left a few signposts to help them find their way. Beautifully written, this is a thoughtful and sensitive book that delivers an unflinchingly honest look at enduring the loss of a loved one.</p><p>S. Michael Wilcox received his PhD from the University of Colorado and recently retired after thirty-seven years as an institute instructor for the Church Educational System. A popular speaker and award-winning author, his previous publications include House of Glory, Fire in the Bones, What the Scriptures Teach Us about Raising a Child, What the Scriptures Teach Us about Prosperity, and What the Scriptures Teach Us about Adversity.</p><h2>The Celtic Golden Dawn: An Original &amp; Complete Curriculum of Druidical Study</h2><p><p>A century ago, Celtic groups descending from the famed Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn pioneered a fascinating form of ceremonial magic invoking Pagan Celtic powers instead of relying on the more commonly used Judeo-Christian names and symbols. Those groups disappeared many decades ago, and their teachings were lost. But today, their legacy has been reborn.</p> <p>Respected occult author and Grand Archdruid John Michael Greer has re-created a complete magical system based on the Celtic Golden Dawn traditions. This new book provides students with a complete curriculum of Druidical magic and occult wisdom, including training in ceremonial magic, meditation, pathworking, divination, geomancy, and herbal alchemy, allowing self-initiation into the three degrees of Ovate, Bard, and Druid. Structured to resemble a long-lost correspondence course, <em>The Celtic Golden Dawn</em> presents a series of knowledge lectures, meditations, and rituals leading to mastery of the most important magical techniques.</p></p><p><p>One of the most respected writers and teachers in the occult field&nbsp;today, John Michael Greer has written more than fifty books on esoteric&nbsp;traditions, nature spirituality, and the future of industrial society.&nbsp;An initiate in Druidic, Hermetic, and Masonic lineages, he served for&nbsp;twelve years as Grand Archdruid of the Ancient Order of Druids in&nbsp;America (AODA).

He lives in Berlin, Germany, with his wife Andrea and with Tango, their black miniature schnauzer. Son of a manager and an artist, Leo became a bit of both when he started designing instruments and setting up a company to bring them to the market. Curious by nature and inspired by a Renaissance spirit, he became a computer engineer, pursued a masters degree in marketing and management, worked many years for companies like IBM and eBay on both sides of the Atlantic, and published articles as a journalist&#x2013;all while adding English, Italian and German languages to his native Spanish along the way. Truth be told, the "Renaissance spirit" also shows up in the form of a shameless affair he maintains with Italian cuisine&#x2013;a mix of heritage and hobby. But in the whole of this history, what remains a leitmotiv is his passion for the ancient art of creat-ing musical instruments, an infatuation that began when he put together his first bass, at 16. Creating something out of nothing. Searching for meaning. Chasing the utopia of perfection. Being a designer does not require much more than that. Nor anything less.</p><h2>Wait for Dark (Bishop/Special Crimes Unit)</h2><p><b>An SCU team investigates a string of accidents, only to uncover a deadly and deliberate monster in this novel from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Kay Hooper.</b>&nbsp;<br><br>In Clarity, North Carolina, the residents have fallen victim to an unfortunate series of events.

Dumb, but no big deal, after all.</p><p><i>Idiot kid, playing in the street. Where are the idiot parents?</i></p><p>She put her foot on the brake pedal to slow down, already mentally rehearsing what she wanted to say to the kid.</p><p>The pedal went all the way to the floor. And the car didn&#x2019;t even slow down.</p><p>Clara hadn&#x2019;t been going very fast since the downtown speed limit was only twenty and rose only to thirty-five in the residential areas surrounding downtown. But as she gripped her steering wheel in growing horror, her foot pumping the unresponsive brake pedal, she realized that the car was not only not slowing&#x2014;it was gaining speed.</p><p>She pressed frantically at the car&#x2019;s horn button, but there was no response. Pushed the button for the car&#x2019;s emergency flashers and, again, no response. No way to warn the little boy she could see more clearly now playing contentedly with a toy dump truck. Even with no one else in sight, she tried to lower the car&#x2019;s window so she could yell a warning at the child. But that didn&#x2019;t work either. Even the steering wheel was fighting her.</p><p>As if the car wanted to run over the boy.</p><p>The needle on the speedometer inched higher, matching the blue numbers in the digital readout that were inexorably climbing as the car&#x2019;s speed increased.</p><p>Clara had no more than seconds to choose between horrible alternatives, and all she knew for sure was that she could not run over a child. So she used all her strength to wrench the resisting steering wheel to the right, trying to aim the car between two others parked at the side of Main Street just before the next intersection. Beyond them was a construction site, as one of the businesses set back from the street was being given a facelift.</p><p>A stack of lumber, she thought, was probably the most forgiving barrier she could see.</p><p>The car turned&#x2014;but just enough to avoid the child, shooting past the opening between the two parked cars, crossing into the empty intersection, and then, engine screaming, speed increasing, plowing headfirst into the thick iron post that held the streetlight out over the lanes.</p><p>Clara never heard the awful crunch of metal or the screaming engine dying with a sputter. She never heard the car&#x2019;s horn begin to screech, or smelled the gasoline.</p><p>Or saw the first flickering flames.</p><p>A blessing, most said later, when word got around. That she never saw. Never knew. A true blessing.</p><p>The little boy stood up, holding his dump truck, and looked with a singular lack of expression at the wreck no more than fifty yards away from him. Then he turned, still expressionless, and walked away, unnoticed by the people spilling out of restaurants and the businesses still open, uninterested in their cries of horror, of frantic shouts for someone to call 911.</p><p>He stopped briefly on the sidewalk, an expression of confusion passing suddenly over his face. He heard the shouts and the first sounds of emergency response people and vehicles, and looked over his shoulder to see flames shooting into the air. It was all he could see, really, because of all the parked cars and all the people.</p><p>He wanted to drop his toy and run in that direction along with everyone else, wanted to see what had happened. It looked awfully interesting, and different for Clarity, where nothing ever really happened.</p><p>He hesitated only because he had a strong feeling his ma would not be happy about him near a fire.</p><p>And now that he thought about it, why <i>was</i> he here? Hadn&#x2019;t he gone to bed? It had to be late, or at least it felt late, and he could have <i>sworn</i> he had gotten into his pajamas and gone to bed&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Sean.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t even have a chance to look up before a large, heavy hand gripped his shoulder. And for an instant, things whirled and flipped inside his head, making him dizzy.</p><p>The sounds down the street died into a peaceful silence, and he realized he just wanted to go home. To go home and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and slip in through the side yard to the window into the laundry room, the one with the broken lock.</p><p>It was the way he always slipped in and out of the house whenever he wanted to break one of his ma&#x2019;s rules or just sneak out to join friends even if he was grounded.</p><p>He got grounded a lot.</p><p>&#x201c;Time for bed, Sean.&#x201d;</p><p>Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was it, that was where he was supposed to be. In bed. He&#x2019;d leave his dump truck outside near the driveway, where his ma would expect to find it. And then he&#x2019;d get back into his pajamas and go to bed.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a dream, Sean. Just a dream. You&#x2019;re fine. You&#x2019;re absolutely fine.&#x201d;</p><p>The soothing voice made sense, and Sean accepted the information it offered. He was asleep and dreaming.</p><p>He just needed to go get back into bed so when he woke up, he&#x2019;d know for sure he&#x2019;d been dreaming.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. I&#x2019;m absolutely fine,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>The heavy hand fell away from his shoulder, and eight-year-old Sean Brenner walked away into the unusually cool evening.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t look back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One</p><p>August</p><p>Thursday</p><p>&#x201c;Accident,&#x201d; Deputy Emma Fletcher said, her tone that of someone who had convinced herself of truth.</p><p>Sheriff Malachi Gordon frowned at her. &#x201c;Yeah? And how many years has Brady Nash used his harvester without getting thrown out of a closed cab and into the teeth of the machine?&#x201d;</p><p>Emma winced, even though describing it, she thought, was never going to have the shock value of seeing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what was left of a man she had grown up knowing. Spread out behind the machine in a bloody trail of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shreds of flesh and jarringly white shards of bone mixed in with the ripped brown stalks and leaves of corn. Like some obscene salad.</p><p>Emma fought a sudden urge to gag and silently told herself to stop with the gross mental images.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Mal demanded.</p><p>Grateful, she dragged her mind back to being a cop. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. A lot of years. Since I was a kid. I remember seeing him plowing his fields in the spring to plant. Harvesting in the summer and into early fall, sometimes late fall. Plowing everything under after the harvest to get ready for winter. He got older and older, but he never seemed to get any slower.&#x201d; She scowled at him. &#x201c;Why are you staring at me like that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just wondering how long it&#x2019;s taken you to convince yourself this was an accident.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All morning,&#x201d; she confessed.</p><p>Mal took a couple of steps back away from the front of the hulking machine until he could look behind it, at the trail of mangled and bloody corn stalks and shreds of human flesh that stretched back for at least a hundred feet.</p><p>&#x201c;No sign it even slowed down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I noticed. And he had to have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He must have gone into the blades way back there, or else there wouldn&#x2019;t be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all the blood and stuff.&#x201d; <i>Field salad. People salad. Farm salad. Stop it!</i> She added hurriedly, &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s a straight path; a car with nobody at the wheel definitely would have wandered left or right. Would a machine like this keep going in a straight line if it wasn&#x2019;t being steered?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea. I&#x2019;d assume so, given ground this level.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even with the ruts?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Especially with the ruts. This machine was designed for planted fields, and they&#x2019;re rutted.&#x201d; Mal shrugged.</p><p>Emma cast about for some other question or tidbit of information she might have and came up empty. Too many questions and too little information. It was unusually cool for an August day even in the mountains; she told herself that was the reason why she jammed both hands into the pockets of her uniform jacket.</p><p>&#x201c;Safety features,&#x201d; Mal muttered. &#x201c;Brady showed me once when I asked. The controls inside the cab. If the operator has a heart attack or something, that&#x2019;s what he said. A kind of dead man&#x2019;s switch; they tend to be on most dangerous machines. The harvester blades stop turning unless the operator is holding that one lever back&#x2014;and it won&#x2019;t stay back by itself. They use the same sort of switch on subway trains. And even in gear, the machine doesn&#x2019;t keep moving forward unless the operator has his foot on the pedal.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma nodded mutely. That made sense. It made all too much sense.</p><p>&#x201c;So why didn&#x2019;t it stop? It comes to that, how the hell was he thrown out of the cab? Doors are fastened securely, glass is intact. And it <i>did</i> come to a stop, here, even though the engine was still running. Even though he couldn&#x2019;t have been inside the cab holding that dead man&#x2019;s switch and with his foot on the pedal all the way down the row since the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. trail starts way back there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Emma said. &#x201c;All&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I&#x2019;m still trying to figure out why he was even out here last night, nowhere near the barns. That&#x2019;s what his wife said, right? That he went out to check on his milk cows late, before turning in himself, because one was due to calve, and so she went on to bed without him. Woke up hours later, just before dawn, realized Brady wasn&#x2019;t in bed. Not that unusual with a cow calving&#x2014;until she heard the harvester, looked out her window, and saw it sitting here, headlights and the lights above the cab glaring, engine running. Their dog had been shut in the barn and was barking his head off; Brady wouldn&#x2019;t have left him in there if he wasn&#x2019;t there himself, since the dog sleeps in the house with them. Sue knew something was wrong. Knew it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just glad she rousted Hank out of bed to check instead of coming out here herself,&#x201d; Mal said. &#x201c;Bad enough he had to see this, and call us, and tell Sue&#x2014;and then come back out and wait until we got here.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked over to the split-rail fence that was more decorative than anything else and bracketed the long dirt driveway up to the farmhouse, noting that Hank Taylor, who was more of a very good friend and partner than an employee to Brady Nash, had his back to the cornfield as he leaned against the fence, gazing off at nothing. The Nashes&#x2019; border collie, Murphy, sat at his side, ostensibly held by a makeshift twine leash even though the dog showed no sign of wanting to go anywhere&#x2014;especially toward the harvester and its gruesome trail.</p><p>Hank, a widower who lived on an adjacent plot of land with a tidy little house just over the hill, within easy walking distance, had been badly shaken and wasn&#x2019;t the sort of man to try to hide it. He and Brady had been as close as brothers.</p><p>Mal walked over to the man and dog by the fence, more out of concern than because he expected to learn anything new.</p><p>&#x201c;Hank?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That didn&#x2019;t happen, Mal,&#x201d; Hank said in a queerly conversational tone, still gazing off into the distance.</p><p>&#x201c;We both know it did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it couldn&#x2019;t have happened. Machines are machines. They work a certain way, the way they&#x2019;re designed to work. They break down or malfunction a certain way. A machine goes wrong, you know why. But this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you?&#x201d; Hank turned his head to stare at the sheriff, a frown creasing the skin between his oddly glazed eyes. &#x201c;Do you understand this? Because I don&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like something I dreamed. It&#x2019;s like a nightmare I can&#x2019;t wake up from.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Look, Hank, why don&#x2019;t you go on home? We&#x2019;ll have people here for hours yet, maybe coming back over days to study what happened here, and the harvester can&#x2019;t be moved until I give the word. Nothing here can be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. changed, until I give the word; we&#x2019;ll be putting up <i>Police Line</i> tape around the whole area. I know where to find you if anybody else has questions you might be able to help answer.&#x201d;</p><p>Hank looked at him a moment longer, still frowning, but then nodded. &#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go tell Sue I can keep Murphy with me for a while, since she has her sister now. He&#x2019;s slept at my place before. I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don&#x2019;t think he wants to stay around here. The&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. smell. Stronger for him, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That sounds good, Hank. You go take care of Murphy. And take care of yourself, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. Sure, Mal. I&#x2019;m fine, though. I&#x2019;m absolutely fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Mal stood there for several moments, staring after the tall lanky man trudging along the fence back toward the house, then slowly returned to the horror in the field and his deputy.</p><p>&#x201c;Is he okay?&#x201d; Emma asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you?&#x201d;</p><p>She drew a short breath and let it out in a rush. &#x201c;Good point. No, I&#x2019;m not okay. I&#x2019;m not even close to being okay, not with stuff like this happening. First that weird car crash, then a grill exploding, and the elevator falling the way it did&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and now this. Four people dead since the middle of July, all from accidents that shouldn&#x2019;t have happened. That&#x2019;s not normal, not for Clarity. I looked it up. The last accidental death here was from a farmer falling off the roof of his barn. Nearly fifteen years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Mal was still frowning, brooding.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been averaging one body a week, Mal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me something I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma cast about mentally once again, then offered a bit uncertainly, &#x201c;Maybe it isn&#x2019;t Brady. I mean, even if Hank seems sure, how do we even know&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His ring.&#x201d;</p><p>She blinked, glanced toward the machine, and then looked hastily away. The clearly male hand was oddly unmarked, jutting up from the bloody metal teeth of the machine from a point between elbow and wrist, fingers relaxed but not curled. And he wore a big ring on that hand, his right hand.</p><p>Emma wasn&#x2019;t really tempted to get any closer. &#x201c;I never noticed him wearing anything except his wedding ring,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you? He never took it off.&#x201d; Mal brooded, still frowning. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s his West Point ring.&#x201d;</p><p>Emma blinked. &#x201c;He went to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Didn&#x2019;t want to be career military, not in the beginning, just wanted the discipline the school offered. Or needed it. Apparently he was a real hellion as a teenager, and his father gave him a choice between some kind of military training or no bail money or quiet word with the judge the next time he landed in jail for being stupid. He was smart enough for West Point, and that&#x2019;s where he went. Told me he actually enjoyed it, that it suited him. Served the required five years in active duty, then chose a few years in the reserves afterward rather than a military career in peacetime. There was the farm to run, but that isn&#x2019;t really why he made the choice. He told me once he was almost sorry his age was never right for wartime. Too young for Vietnam; too old for all the Middle East wars since.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt Sue was sorry,&#x201d; Emma offered. &#x201c;At least they had a lot of good years together before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this.&#x201d;</p><p>Mal nodded, still clearly preoccupied.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you thinking?&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at her for a moment as if he didn&#x2019;t see her, and then obviously brought her into focus. &#x201c;My gut tells me there&#x2019;s something we&#x2019;re not seeing in all this, some kind of connection. And I&#x2019;m thinking it&#x2019;s time we called in someone wh...</p></p><h2>Islands of Profit in a Sea of Red Ink: Why 40 Percent of Your Business Is Unprofitable and How to Fix It</h2><p>Top companies around the world turn to MIT's Jonathan Byrnes to figure out where the profit is. Using his systematic process for analyzing profitability, they can quickly determine which parts of the business are worth expanding and which are just a drain on resources. Then, using Byrnes's "profit levers," they can turn unprofitable business into good business and good business into great business. <br><br> We now live in the Age of Precision Markets, yet most of the management processes taught in business schools were developed for the prior Age of Mass Markets. Today's savviest managers are exploiting this disconnect. They're rethinking strategy, customer relations, operations, and metrics, and overcoming internal resistance to constructive change. They also reject such harmful myths as: <br><br> * Revenues are good, costs are bad <br><br> * All customers should get the same great service <br><br> * If everyone does his or her job well, the company will prosper <br><br> Byrnes reveals an uncomfortable truth: It's possible, even easy, for everyone to meet or exceed their budget targets and for the company still to have an enormous portion of the business unprofitable by any measure. But profit levers can flip everything around. For instance, several leading companies have utilized profit levers to increase their sales by over 35 percent in their highest penetrated customers, while others have reduced their operating costs- and their customers' costs-by over 30 percent One company described in the book raised its net profits by over 50 percent in a three-year period. The book is a practical, step-by-step guide to achieving these results. <br><br> Every business has enormous potential waiting to be unleashed; this book offers bold new strategies to help you find and grow those islands of profit.</p><p><b>Jonathan L.

Based on a profound understanding of the ways in which young children learn, it shows teachers how to launch a writing workshop by inviting children to do what they do naturally - make stuff. So why not write books? </p> <p> Gifted educator and author of the best-selling <i>What You Know by Heart</i> (Heinemann, 2002), Katie Wood Ray has seen young authors do just that. And she wants your students to be able to do the same. Beautifully describing young children in the act of learning, she demonstrates what it takes to nourish writing right from the start: </p><ul> <li>a supportive environment that enables even the youngest students to write</li> <li>respect and sensitivity to the way children really learn</li> <li>inviting instruction that both encourages and elevates young writers</li> <li>rich language that stimulates writing</li> <li>classroom talk and children's literature that energize young writers</li> <li>developmental considerations that shape the structure of the workshop, making it natural, joyful, and absolutely appropriate.</li> </ul> What's more, Ray explains step by step how to set up and maintain a primary writing workshop, detailing eleven units of study that cover idea generation, text structures, different genres, and illustrations that work with text. She also draws on data, projects, and the language of teaching used in the classroom of first-grade teacher Lisa Cleaveland. Ray allows readers to "listen in" to Lisa as she helps her young students learn from professional writers, work with intention, and think about their own process. <p></p> <p> Chockfull of examples of little books by young children, <i>About the Authors</i> is proof positive that a primary writing workshop is a smart writing move. </p></p><p><p>For many years as the author of bestselling Heinemann books such as About the Authors, Study Driven, Already Ready, and In Pictures and In Words, and as a member of Heinemann's Professional Development Services, Katie Wood Ray gave teachers resources and PD that transformed writing instruction and helped children discover a lifelong love of writing. In 2014, Katie "moved to the other side of the desk" and joined the dynamic team of editors at Heinemann where she works closely with authors to craft powerful professional books on a range of literacy topics. Katie is also the series editor for the new Classroom Essentials books from Heinemann. Tasked with bringing foundational, progressive practices to a new generation of teachers, Katie works to ensure that the sharp focus and enhanced design of each book best serve the content. She also teamed up with her longtime collaborator, Lisa Cleaveland, to write one of the first books in the series, A Teacher's Guide to Getting Started with Beginning Writers.

One of the most popular science fiction novels ever written, it has become a worldwide phenomenon, winning awards, selling millions of copies around the world. In the prophetic year of 1984, <i>Dune</i> was made into a motion picture directed by David Lynch, and it has recently been produced as a three-part miniseries on the Sci-Fi Channel. Though he is best remembered for <i>Dune</i>, Frank Herbert was the author of more than twenty books at the time of his tragic death in 1986, including such classic novels as <i>The Green Brain, The Santaroga Barrier, The White Plague</i> and <i>Dosadi Experiment</i>.</p><p>Brian Herbert, Frank Herbert's eldest son, tells the provocative story of his father's extraordinary life in this honest and loving chronicle. He has also brought to light all the events in Herbert's life that would find their way into speculative fiction's greatest epic.</p><p>From his early years in Tacoma, Washington, and his education at the University of Washington, Seattle, and in the Navy, through the years of trying his hand as a TV cameraman, radio commentator, reporter, and editor of several West Coast newspaper, to the difficult years of poverty while struggling to become a published writer, Herbert worked long and hard before finding success after the publication of <i>Dune</i> in 1965. Brian Herbert writes about these years with a truthful intensity that brings every facet of his father's brilliant, and sometimes troubled, genius to full light.</p><p>Insightful and provocative, containing family photos never published anywhere, this absorbing biography offers Brian Herbert' unique personal perspective on one of the most enigmatic and creative talents of our time.</p><p><i>Dreamer of Dune</i> is a 2004 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Related Work.</p></p><p><p><b>Brian Herbert</b>, the author of numerous novels and short stories, has been critically acclaimed by leading reviewers in the United States and around the world. The eldest son of science fiction superstar Frank Herbert, he, with Kevin J. Anderson, is the author of <i>Hellhole</i> and continues his father's beloved Dune series with books including <i>The Winds of Dune</i>, <i>House Atreides</i>, <i>Sandworms of Dune</i>, among other bestsellers. Herbert graduated from high school at age 16, and then attended U.C. Berkeley, where he earned a B.A. in Sociology. Besides an author, Herbert has been an editor, business manager, board game inventor, creative consultant for television and collectible card games, insurance agent, award-winning encyclopedia salesman, waiter, busboy, maid and a printer. He and his wife once owned a double-decker London bus, which they converted into an unusual gift shop. Herbert and his wife, Jan, have three daughters. They live in Washington state.</p><p><strong>CHAPTER 1</strong><br><br><strong>Adventures in Darkest Africa</strong><br>Frank Herbert&#x2019;s paternal grandfather, Otto, was born in 1864 on a boat while coming to America from Bavaria with other immigrants. As a young man, Otto met Mary Ellen Stanley, an illiterate Kentucky hill-woman. By the turn of the century the couple was living in Cairo, Illinois, with five sons.<strong>*</strong> Otto worked as a solicitor for a steam laundry there, and subsequently on the line in a bottling works. A restless, energetic man, he began attending meetings sponsored by the Social Democracy of America. This was a socialist group, founded and led by Eugene V. Debs. The SDA had a plan to colonize certain Western states, including the state of Washington, in order to dominate the politics of those regions. Eventually they hoped to alter the moral and economic order of the entire country. But the colonization idea was steeped in controversy, and socialist leaders, including Debs himself, came to feel that it was not the most efficient utilization of people and assets on behalf of the socialist cause. Political action in the cities and mill towns would produce better results, they thought.<br>Still, Burley Colony in Washington State was founded in 1898 by "the Co-operative Brotherhood," an SDA splinter group that pushed forward with the colonization plan. Burley Colony was on Burley Lagoon at the head of Henderson Bay, just north of Tacoma. This was a shallow lagoon where whales were sometimes trapped when the tide went out.<br>The colonists were idealistic, advocating universal brotherhood, equal pay for all jobs and equal rights for women. They had mottoes like "Make way for brotherhood, make way for man" and "Do your best and be kind." They liked to say "ours" instead of "mine," and "we" instead of "I." Each colonist received broad medical insurance.<br>At its zenith, Burley was headquarters for an organization having 1,200 members all over the world&#x2014;only a minority of whom actually lived in the commune. There were affiliated "Temples of the Knights of Brotherhood" all over the United States, including facilities in Seattle, Tacoma, Fairhaven (Washington), Portland (Oregon), San Francisco, Reno and Chicago. Contributions came in from powerful social organizations in Chicago, New York City and Rochester.<br>It was a short-lived colony, an experiment in socialist utopia that would last only a decade and a half. But at its height, the colony had a large church, community hall, library, schoolhouse, post office, sawmill, shingle mill, hotel and dining hall, general store, blacksmith&#x2019;s shop, dairy, laundry, and many other mercantile businesses. They printed a socialist newspaper and colony currency, in the form of coupons good for purchases at commune businesses. They had factories for the preserving of catsup and pickles, and a cigar factory&#x2014;the largest in Washington State. The cigar factory produced Marine Cigars, selling for three to six cents apiece. They were excellent and popular, made of fine Kentucky burley tobacco, imported to the colony. Hence the colony&#x2019;s name: Burley. Cigar boxes and labels were produced locally as well.<br>Today the town of Burley, with only a few houses, a general store, a community hall and a post office, is but a shadow of its former self. Most of the buildings, including the mills, the hotel, and the cigar factory, are long gone. Many houses, built without concrete foundations, have decayed into the ground.<br>In 1905, Otto and Mary, now with six sons, and Otto&#x2019;s younger brother, Frank, took a train from Illinois across the Great Northern route to Washington State and thence through recently opened Stampede Pass to Tacoma. From Tacoma it was a short steamboat ride across the narrows to Gig Harbor, followed by a six-mile trip by horse-drawn stage to the colony through thick virgin forests. Otto and his brother each took a small government land grant just outside of Burley and set about making themselves part of the community. With his brother&#x2019;s assistance, Otto built a two-story log house, and ultimately the Herberts bought property inside Burley itself&#x2014;land that curved around the lagoon.<br>Burley, called "Circle City" by locals because of the arrangement of buildings in a half-circle around an artesian well, had undergone a dramatic economic change shortly before the arrival of the Herberts. Through an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the colony, private ownership of land and industry was permitted. The Brotherhood remained in control, with profits going in equal shares to members. But this was no longer the socialist utopia originally envisioned by its founders. It was a curious amalgam of socialism and capitalism, and would last only eight more years before falling apart entirely.<br>But even with the departure of the Brotherhood in 1913, a community remained, with many former co-op members staying in the area. The land of this valley was dark and fertile, excellent for farming. Other former co-op members logged, operated dairies and raised poultry. For many years Burley remained the center of intellectual and social activity for the county.<br>There were three Frank Herberts in my family. The first, Otto&#x2019;s brother, eventually gave up his land near Burley and went on the circus and vaudeville circuit as "Professor Herbert," becoming a well-known performer of strongman feats, gymnastics and daredevil acts. The next Frank Herbert, known as "F. H." in ensuing years, was Otto&#x2019;s third son, born in December, 1893, in Ballard County, Kentucky. F. H. in turn had a son, Frank Jr., who would become my father and one of the world&#x2019;s best-known authors.<br>In Burley, Otto, Mary and their children prospered and increased family real estate holdings. For many years Otto operated a general store, "Herbert&#x2019;s Store." The establishment carried, in the words of an old-timer, "everything from tires to toothpicks." It had hay, grain, cow-feed, chickenfeed, clothing, medicines, dishes, hardware and most everything else imaginable, piled high to the ceiling. It was not a "green grocery," as it sold no fresh produce. The locals grew their own vegetables and fruit, and canned them. Credit slips hung on the wall behind the cash register.<br>Otto&#x2019;s sons worked with him in the store, and when they grew up they formed "Herbert Brothers," which operated the family store, a gas station, an auto and electrical repair shop, a stage line, and a logging business.<br>A stern, stocky little man, Otto was the undisputed ruler of his household. He named all six of his sons, and it is said that he did so without input from Mary. The boys were raised with stern "German discipline," as my father called it later, the same sort of attention he would in turn receive from his father.<br>* * *<br>At 7:30 in the morning on October 8, 1920, Frank Herbert, Jr., was born at St. Joseph Hospital in Tacoma. It was his mother&#x2019;s nineteenth birthday, and he would often joke in later years that he never forgot her birthday.<br>F. H. and his wife, Eileen, were living in Tacoma at the time of their son&#x2019;s birth, but at every opportunity they visited Burley and the extended family there. Fond memories were formed in this little town on a lagoon, and these halcyon times would have a lasting impact upon young Frank Herbert. At the time of Frank&#x2019;s birth, his father was operating an auto-bus line between Tacoma and Aberdeen to the south&#x2014;an offshoot of the family&#x2019;s successful stage line that ran between Burley and Gig Harbor.<br>The business became unprofitable, however, and by 1923 F. H. was working in Tacoma as an electrical equipment salesman.

Unhinged environmentalism is not the answer, but neither are ignorance and apathy. It&#39;s time for something different. Christian responsibility for the natural world goes back to the very beginning, when God commanded us to &#34;fill the earth and subdue it.&#34; This Dominion Mandate is an authoritative alternative to both environmental activists and to those who think &#34;conservation&#34; is a word progressives made up. So what does &#34;dominion&#34; mean for us, living in a world of constant reports about impending global meltdown; of oils spills, pollution, and strip-mining; of extinction threats both real and imagined? A Different Shade of Green contains a compelling Christian approach to biodiversity, life cycles, and the environment, offering solutions and correcting errors while teaching us how to give thanks for and rule over all of creation.</p><p><b>Dr. Gordon Wilson</b> is Senior Fellow of Natural History at New Saint Andrews College in Moscow, Idaho, and has also taught a wide array of biology courses at Liberty University.

By providing us with a clearer understanding of the context of these stories in Jesus' immediate culture, Claypool demonstrates how accessible the parables were to his listeners, told in familiar terms that everyone who heard them could grasp. He writes:<br><br>&#x201c;This is how Jesus worked the miracle of reconciliation again and again. People would come to him in all degrees of panic, fear, and anger. Yet, instead of confronting them head-on and driving them deeper into their defensiveness, he would, like Nathan, defuse their anxiety by saying, &#x2018;Let me tell you a story. . . .' Then, drawn in by the narrative and with their defenses down, the listeners would see the story as a mirror, and its light would make their personal darkness visible. In this way, parables became events of revelation.&#x201d;<br>And so it is with us, Claypool believes. When we open the deep places in our being to the parables&#x2015;these stories Jesus still tells&#x2015;then in a moment of surprise and insight, we who listen recognize ourselves in the characters and the decisions they face. The stories are no longer about them, but about us, and the opportunity for illumination and transformation in our own lives.</p><p><b>JOHN CLAYPOOL</b> served as rector of St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Widely known as a speaker, preacher, and pastor, he authored numerous books, including <i>Mending the Heart</i>.This may be a second edition, but the material is as fresh in 2000 as it was in 1993. Claypool presents 10 chapters, or sermons, on 12 parables of Jesus . . . and offers stimulating insights and applications. . . . You may not agree with every interpretation or application Claypool makes, but you can be enriched in your preaching of the parables through his work. (Erwin J.

It is, rather, the project, both art and science, of living to God in intelligent, affectionate, and obedient response to God&#x2019;s Word. The seminary is no ivory tower but a crucible in which Christian wisdom and spirituality are tested and refined&#x2015;not only, or even primarily, by exams, but by the vital tests of everyday life. <em>How to Stay Christian in Seminary</em> alerts students to the real curriculum that undergirds degree structures: the pedagogy of the triune God that aims at forming the mind and heart of Jesus Christ in students and disciples.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Kevin J.

Some lost their families. Some lost their integrity. The Devil wants to bring down ministers of the gospel, and he usually erects the demolition scaffolding in seminary, when we&#x2019;re too occupied with Greek flash cards to see the shadow of the pitchfork on the wall.

The book begins by tracing the first waves of critical scholarship in the field through a close, contextual study of the intellectual and political projects of several core figures including, Paulo Freire, Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, Michael Apple, and Henry Giroux. Later chapters offer a discussion of feminist critiques, the influx of postmodernist and poststructuralist ideas in education, and critical theories of race. </p> <p></p> <p>While grounded in U.S. scholarship, <i>The Critical Turn in&nbsp;Education </i>contextualizes the development of critical ideas and political projects within a larger international history, and charts the ongoing theoretical debates that seek to explain the relationship between school and society. Today, much of the language of this critical turn has now become commonplace&#x2015;words such as "hegemony," "ideology," and the term "critical" itself&#x2015;but by providing a historical analysis, <i>The Critical Turn in Education </i>illuminates the complexity and nuance of these theoretical tools, which offer ways of understanding the intersections between individual identities and structural forces in an attempt to engage and overturn social injustice. </p></p><p><p><strong>Isaac Gottesman</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the School of Education at Iowa State University. </p><p>Gottesman&#x2019;s book should be enthusiastically and widely read, and hopefully should set the tone for many more conversations on the status of critical educational studies, its epistemologies of ignorance, its sustenance in uncertain and fragmented times, and its future.</p> <p>--<em>Teachers College Record</em>, December 2017</p> <p>Isaac Gottesman establishes himself as an intellectual&#x2019;s historian. Never before has there been such a detailed accounting of the Educational Left. He does more than trace the critical turn in education from Marxism to feminism to critical race theory. Gottesman provides the analytics that force us all to struggle with the burdens of the past without a clear path to the future other than the insistence on social justice. Books like <i>The Critical Turn in Education </i>only appear once in a generation. We don&#x2019;t just read it, we are deeply affected by it. </p> <p>--Zeus Leonardo, Professor of Education and the Critical Theory Designated Emphasis, University of California, Berkeley</p> <p>Isaac Gottesman's smart little book represents our first truly critical history of the "critical turn" in education. As Gottesman shows, self-described critical theorists have too often insulated themselves within their own fiefdoms.

In the end, McQuilkin maintains Scripture can be understood by anyone, simply by following a set of straightforward and time-tested principles.</p></p><p><b>ROBERTSON McQUILKIN</b> served as the third president of Columbia International University from 1968 to 1990 and currently serves as the president emeritus.

An electrifying and traumatic encounter in the sixties crystallized these furious disputes.</p><p>In 1963 Attorney General Robert Kennedy sought out James Baldwin to explain the rage that threatened to engulf black America. Baldwin brought along some friends, including playwright Lorraine Hansberry, psychologist Kenneth Clark, and a valiant activist, Jerome Smith. It was Smith&#x2019;s relentless, unfiltered fury that set Kennedy on his heels, reducing him to sullen silence.</p><p>Kennedy walked away from the nearly three-hour meeting angry &#x2013; that the black folk assembled didn&#x2019;t understand politics, and that they weren&#x2019;t as easy to talk to as Martin Luther King. But especially that they were more interested in witness than policy. But Kennedy&#x2019;s anger quickly gave way to empathy, especially for Smith. &#x201c;I guess if I were in his shoes...I might feel differently about this country.&#x201d; Kennedy set about changing policy &#x2013; the meeting having transformed his thinking in fundamental ways.</p><p>There was more: every big argument about race that persists to this day got a hearing in that room. Smith declaring that he&#x2019;d never fight for his country given its racist tendencies, and Kennedy being appalled at such lack of patriotism, tracks the disdain for black dissent in our own time. His belief that black folk were ungrateful for the Kennedys&#x2019; efforts to make things better shows up in our day as the charge that black folk wallow in the politics of ingratitude and victimhood. The contributions of black queer folk to racial progress still cause a stir. BLM has been accused of harboring a covert queer agenda. The immigrant experience, like that of Kennedy &#x2013; versus the racial experience of Baldwin &#x2013; is a cudgel to excoriate black folk for lacking hustle and ingenuity. The questioning of whether folk who are interracially partnered can authentically communicate black interests persists. And we grapple still with the responsibility of black intellectuals and artists to bring about social change.</p><p><i>What Truth Sounds Like</i> exists at the tense intersection of the conflict between politics and prophecy &#x2013; of whether we embrace political resolution or moral redemption to fix our fractured racial landscape. The future of race and democracy hang in the balance.</p></p><p>MICHAEL ERIC DYSON is one of America&#x2019;s premier public intellectuals and the author of the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Tears We Cannot Stop</i>.

In this essential reconsideration of the creation and legacy of our nation&#x2019;s founding document, Sean Wilentz reveals the tortured compromises that led the Founders to abide slavery without legitimizing it, a deliberate ambiguity that fractured the nation seventy years later. Contesting the Southern proslavery version of the Constitution, Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass pointed to the framers&#x2019; refusal to validate what they called &#x201c;property in man.&#x201d; <i>No Property in Man</i> has opened a fresh debate about the political and legal struggles over slavery that began during the Revolution and concluded with the Civil War.

Wilentz&#x2019;s writings on American music have earned him two Grammy nominations and two Deems-Taylor-ASCAP awards.&#x201c;What does Wilentz know that others have gotten so terribly wrong about the founding connection between slavery and racism? In his revealing and passionately argued book, he insists that because the framers did not sanction slavery as a matter of principle, the antislavery legacy of the Constitution has been &#x2018;slighted&#x2019; and &#x2018;misconstrued&#x2019; for over 200 years.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Khalil Gibran Muhammad</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Examines the debate over the legal status of enslaved people that began with the writing of the Constitution and continued up to the Civil War&#x2015;a period in American history in which he finds an important lesson for how to achieve political change in a democracy...No American historian of his generation has written so well on so many different subjects; few even come close.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Demonstrating that the Constitution both protected slavery and left open the possibility of an antislavery politics, Wilentz&#x2019;s careful and insightful analysis helps us understand how Americans who hated slavery, such as Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, could come to see the Constitution as an ally in their struggle.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Foner, author of the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Stimulating...draws on letters, speeches and public debates to enlarge our sense of slavery&#x2019;s political dimension in the founding period.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David S.

The Constitution possessed fatal complicity with racial slavery but also sowed seeds of its destruction. Wilentz brings a lifetime of learning and a mastery of political history to this brilliant book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David W.

Clearly and without apology, Wilentz explains the framers&#x2019; familiar compromises with slavery. But until now no historian has examined the critical concession antislavery delegates refused to make. There would be no constitutional right of property in man.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Oakes, author of <i>The Scorpion&#x2019;s Sting: Antislavery and the Coming of the Civil War</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Was the U.S. Constitution, as the South Carolinian states-man John C. Calhoun believed, a pro-slavery document, or did it, as President Abraham Lincoln argued, deny slavery a place in national law and point toward abolition? Although most Americans outside the academy would assume that Calhoun was wrong and Lincoln right, the contrary view has gained so much ground among academics in recent years that Wilentz&#x2019;s qualified endorsement of Lincoln&#x2019;s interpretation is both bracing and brave.

Westminster: School Desegregation and Mexican-American Rights (Landmark Law Cases &amp; American Society)</h2><p>While <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> remains much more famous, Mendez v. Westminster School District (1947) was actually the first case in which segregation in education was successfully challenged in federal court. Finally giving Mendez its due, Philippa Strum provides a concise and compelling account of its legal issues and legacy, while retaining its essential human face: that of Mexican Americans unwilling to accept second-class citizenship. 1945 Gonzalo and Felcitas Mendez, California farmers, sent their children off to the local school, only to be told that the youngsters would have to attend a separate facility reserved for Mexican Americans. In response the Mndezes and other aggrieved parents from nearby school districts went to federal court to challenge the segregation. Uniquely, they did not claim racial discrimination, since Mexicans were legally considered white, but rather discrimination based on ancestry and supposed "language deficiency" that denied their children their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection under the law.<br><br>In 1945 Gonzalo and Felicitas Mendez, California farmers, sent their children off to the local school, only to be told that the youngsters would have to attend a separate facility reserved for Mexican Americans.

Uniquely, they did not claim racial discrimination, since Mexicans were legally considered white, but rather discrimination based on ancestry and supposed "language deficiency" that denied their children their Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection under the law.<br><br>Strum tells how, thanks to attorney David Marcus's carefully crafted arguments, federal district court judge Paul McCormick came to support the plaintiffs on the grounds that the social, psychological, and pedagogical costs of segregated education were damaging to Mexican-American children. The school districts claimed that federal courts had no jurisdiction over education, but the Ninth Circuit upheld McCormick's decision, ruling that the schools' actions violated California law. The appeal to the Ninth Circuit was supported by amicus briefs from leading civil liberties organizations, including the NAACP, which a few years later would adapt the arguments of Mendez in representing the plaintiffs in Brown.<br><br>Strum effectively weaves together narrative and analysis with personality portraits to create a highly readable and accessible story, allowing us to hear the voices of all the protagonists. She also presents the issues evenhandedly, effectively balancing her presentation of arguments by both the plaintiffs and the schools that sought to continue the segregation of Mexican-American students.<br><br>Ultimately, Mendez highlights how Mexican Americans took the lead to secure their civil rights and demonstrates how organization, courage, and persistence in the Mexican-American communities could overcome the racism of the school boards. Their inspiring example is particularly timely given the current controversies over immigration and the growing national interest in Latino life.</p><p>"<i>Mendez v. Westminster</i> plays an underappreciated role in the struggle for civil rights in the United States. Strum brings the people and debates of the case vividly to life, particularly the dedication of the Latino parents at the center of the case who fought for equal education for their children in public schools. . . .

But as these Norse warriors left their strongholds to trade, raid, and settle across wide areas of Europe, Asia, and the North Atlantic, their violent and predatory culture left a unique imprint on medieval history. The twist that no one predicted, however, was a much slower, insidious takeover than any the Vikings would execute, and by a turn of the tide, they themselves became its target. For as they made their mark on Europe, Europe made its mark on them. By the year 1200, what remained of the Vikings&#x2019; pagan origins floated beneath the surface and the strong, strange territories of the north had become a part of Latin Christendom.</p><p><i>Northmen</i> is there to tell the tale, to pay homage to what was lost and celebrate what was won. Focusing on key events, including the sack of Lindisfarne in 793 and the Battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066, medieval history expert John Haywood recounts the saga of the Viking Age, from the creation of the world through to the dwindling years of halfhearted raids and elegiac storytelling in the thirteenth century. He does so with meticulous research, engaging narrative, and sensitivity for his subject, shedding light and blood along the way.</p></p><p>DR.

In today's corporate upheaval, a new business paradigm is evolving. While many CEOs are being exposed for their greed, truly visionary leaders believe in a goal that benefits themselves as well as others. They realize that it is their vision and "soul" that attract loyal employees willing to go above and beyond the call of corporate duty. And their employees are realizing the same thing: while 80 percent of adults claim they'd work even if they didn't have to, the majority of them can hardly wait to leave their jobs and get home.<p><b>Good Business</b> starts with the premise that this is an age in which business and work have replaced religion and politics as central forces in contemporary life. The book reveals how business leaders, managers, and even employees can find their "flow" and contribute not only to their own happiness, but also to a just and evolving society. It identifies the factors crucial to the operation of a good business: trust, the commitment to fostering the personal growth of employees, and the dedication to creating a product that helps mankind. <b>Good Business</b> is sure to become a must-read text for anyone who values the positive contributions of individuals in the changing world of business.</p></p><p>In psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's definition of leadership, the personal is political. The best-selling author of <i>Flow</i> interviewed several dozen exemplary CEOs whose wisdom provides the radical job description of the book&#x2019;s premise: "Leaders must make it possible for employees to work with joy, to their heart&#x2019;s content, while responding to the needs of society." Csikszentmihalyi leverages his definition of "flow"&#x2014;-the capacity for full engagement in an activity&#x2014;-to create a blueprint for a workplace in which bringing out the best in workers comes before products and profit. When leaders select and reward employees who find satisfaction at work, they can create an upwardly moral organization.<p> In this view, leadership is a privilege that requires checking ego in the coatroom and peering into the mirror to ask tough questions. For example, "How do I determine if something is right or wrong?" Or, "What is my business doing to benefit human well being?" He offers some inspiring stories from leaders who engage employees to go with the flow, including Body Shop CEO Anita Roddick, Patagonia crown prince Yvon Chouinard, and media mogul Ted Turner. Some of Csikszentmihalyi&#x2019;s advice will sound familiar. Yet he creates a compellingly fresh vision of good business in both a material and spiritual sense. Ultimately, the success of this book lies in its powerful, non-flaky ability to define corporate soul in terms of a company becoming a stakeholder in an entity larger than itself.--<i>Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced &#x201c;chick-sent-me-high&#x201d;), author of the&nbsp;<b>New York Times</b> bestseller <b>Flow</b>,&nbsp;is a professor of management at the Claremont Graduate Center.

They include the Bedwyn saga, the Simply quartet, the Huxtable quintet, the seven-part Survivors&#x2019; Club series, and the Westcott series.<p></p><p>1</p><p>There could surely be nothing worse than having been born a woman, Chloe Muirhead thought with unabashed self-pity as she sucked a globule of blood off her left forefinger and looked to see if any more was about to bubble up and threaten to ruin the strip of delicate lace she was sewing back onto one of the Duchess of Worthingham&#x2019;s best afternoon caps. Unless, perhaps, one had the good fortune to be a duchess. Or else a single lady in possession of forty thousand pounds a year and the freedom to set up one&#x2019;s own independent establishment.</p><p>She, alas, was not a duchess. Or in sole possession of even forty <i>pence</i> a year apart from her allowance from her father. Besides, she did not <i>want</i> to set up somewhere independently. It sounded suspiciously lonely. She could not really claim to be lonely now. The duchess was kind to her. So was the duke in his gruff way. And whenever Her Grace entertained afternoon visitors or went visiting herself, she always invited Chloe to join her.</p><p>It was not the duchess&#x2019;s fault that she was eighty-two years old to Chloe&#x2019;s twenty-seven. Or that the neighbors with whom she consorted most frequently must all be upward of sixty. In some cases they were very much upward. Mrs. Booth, for example, who always carried a large ear trumpet and let out a loud, querulous &#x201c;Eh?&#x201d; every time someone so much as opened her mouth to speak, was ninety-three.</p><p>If she had been born male, Chloe thought, rubbing her thumb briskly over her forefinger to make sure the bleeding had stopped and it was safe to pick up her needle again, she might have done all sorts of interesting, adventurous things when she had felt it imperative to leave home. As it was, all <i>she</i> had been able to think of to do was write to the Duchess of Worthingham, who was her mother&#x2019;s godmother and had been her late grandmother&#x2019;s dearest friend, and offer her services as a companion. An <i>unpaid</i> companion, she had been careful to explain.</p><p>A kind and gracious letter had come back within days, as well as a sealed note for Chloe&#x2019;s father. The duchess would be delighted to welcome dear Chloe to Manville Court, but as a guest, <i>not</i> as an employee&#x2014;the <i>not</i> had been capitalized and heavily underlined. And Chloe might stay as long as she wished&#x2014;forever, if the duchess had her way. She could not think of anything more delightful than to have someone young to brighten her days and make <i>her</i> feel young again. She only hoped Sir Kevin Muirhead could spare his daughter for a prolonged visit. She showed wonderful tact in adding that, of course; as she had in writing separately to him, for Chloe had explained in her own letter just why living at home had become intolerable to her, at least for a while, much as she loved her father and hated to upset him.</p><p>So she had come. She would be forever grateful to the duchess, who treated her more like a favored granddaughter than a virtual stranger and basically self-invited guest. But oh, she <i>was</i> lonely too. One could be lonely and unhappy while being grateful at the same time, could one not?</p><p>And, ah, yes. She was unhappy too.</p><p>Her world had been turned completely upside down <i>twice</i> within the past six years, which ought to have meant, if life proceeded along logical lines, as it most certainly did not, that the second time it was turned right side up again. She had lost everything any young woman could ever ask for the first time&#x2014;hopes and dreams, the promise of love and marriage and happily-ever-after, the prospect of security and her own place in society. Hope had revived last year, though in a more muted and modest form. But that had been dashed too, and her very identity had hung in the balance. In the four years between the two disasters her mother had died. Was it any wonder she was unhappy?</p><p>She gave the delicate needlework her full attention again. If she allowed herself to wallow in self-pity, she would be in danger of becoming one of those habitual moaners and complainers everyone avoided.</p><p>It was still only very early in May. A largish mass of clouds covered the sun and did not look as if it planned to move off anytime soon, and a brisk breeze was gusting along the east side of the house, directly across the terrace outside the morning room, where Chloe sat sewing. It had not been a sensible idea to come outside, but it had rained quite unrelentingly for the past three days, and she had been desperate to escape the confines of the house and breathe in some fresh air.</p><p>She ought to have brought her shawl out with her, even her cloak and gloves, she thought, though then of course she would not have been able to sew, and she had promised to have the cap ready before the duchess awoke from her afternoon sleep. Dratted cap and dratted lace. But that was quite unfair, for she had volunteered to do it even when the duchess had made a mild protest.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you quite sure it will be no trouble, my dear?&#x201d; she had asked. &#x201c;Bunker is perfectly competent with a needle.&#x201d;</p><p>Miss Bunker was her personal maid.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I am,&#x201d; Chloe had assured her. &#x201c;It will be my pleasure.&#x201d;</p><p>The duchess always had that effect upon her. For all the obvious sincerity of her welcome and kindness of her manner, Chloe felt the obligation, if not to earn her living, then at least to make herself useful whenever she was able.</p><p>She was shivering by the time she completed her task and cut the thread with fingers that felt stiff from the cold. She held out the cap, draped over her right fist. The stitches were invisible. No one would be able to tell that a repair had been made.</p><p>She did not want to go back inside despite the cold. The duchess would probably be up from her sleep and would be in the drawing room bright with happy anticipation of the expected arrival of her grandson. She would be eager to extol his many virtues yet again though he had not been to Manville since Christmas. Chloe was tired of hearing of his virtues. She doubted he had any.</p><p>Not that she had ever met him in person to judge for herself, it was true. But she did know him by reputation. He and her brother, Graham, had been at school together. Ralph Stockwood, who had since assumed his father&#x2019;s courtesy title of Earl of Berwick, had been a charismatic leader there. He had been liked and admired and emulated by almost all the other boys, even though he had also been one of a close-knit group of four handsome, athletic, clever boys. Graham had spoken critically and disapprovingly of Ralph Stockwood, though Chloe had always suspected that he envied that favored inner circle.</p><p>After school, the four friends all took up commissions in the same prestigious cavalry regiment and went off to the Peninsula to fight the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte, while Graham went to Oxford to study theology and become a clergyman. He had arrived home from the final term at school upset because Ralph Stockwood had called him a sniveling prig and lily-livered coward. Chloe did not know the context in which the insult had been hurled, but she had not felt kindly disposed toward Graham&#x2019;s erstwhile schoolmate ever since. And she never had liked the sound of him. She did not like boys, or men, who lorded it arrogantly over others and accepted their homage as a right.</p><p>Not many months after they had embarked for the Peninsula, Lieutenant Stockwood&#x2019;s three friends had been killed in the same battle, and he had been carried off the field and then home to England so severely wounded that he had not been expected to survive.</p><p>Chloe had felt sorry for him at the time, but her sympathies had soon been alienated again. Graham, in his capacity as a clergyman, had called upon him in London a day or two after he had been brought home from Portugal. Graham had been admitted to the sickroom, but the wounded man had sworn foully at him and ordered him to get out and never come back.</p><p>Chloe did not expect to like the Earl of Berwick, then, even if he <i>was</i> the Duke of Worthingham&#x2019;s heir and the duchess&#x2019;s beloved only grandson. She had not forgiven his description of her brother as a lily-livered coward. Graham was a <i>pacifist</i>. That did not make him a coward. Indeed, it took a great deal of courage to stand up for peace against men who were in love with war. And she had not forgiven the earl for cursing Graham after he had been injured without even listening to what Graham had come to say. The fact that he had undoubtedly been in great pain at the time did not excuse such rudeness to an old school friend. She had decided long ago that the earl was brash, arrogant, self-centered, even heartless.</p><p>And he was on his way to Manville Court. He was coming at the duchess&#x2019;s behest, it must be added, not because he had chosen of his own free will to visit the grandparents who doted on him. Chloe suspected that the summons had something to do with the duke&#x2019;s health, which had been causing Her Grace some concern for the past couple of months. She fancied that he was coughing more than usual and that his habit of covering his heart with one hand when he did so was a bad sign. He did not complain of feeling unwell&#x2014;not, at least, in Chloe&#x2019;s hearing&#x2014;and he saw his physician only when the duchess insisted. Afterward he called the doctor an old quack who knew no better than to prescribe pills and potions that served only to make the duke feel ill.</p><p>Chloe did not know what the true state of the duke&#x2019;s health was, but she did know that he had celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday last autumn, and eighty-five was an awfully advanced age to be.</p><p>However it was, the Earl of Berwick had been summoned and he was expected today. Chloe did not want to meet him. She knew she would not like him. More important, perhaps, she admitted reluctantly to herself, she did not want him to meet <i>her,</i> a sort of charity guest of his grandmother&#x2019;s, an aging, twenty-seven-year-old spinster with a doubtful reputation and no prospects. A pathetic creature, in fact.</p><p>But the thought finally triggered laughter&#x2014;at her own expense. She had whipped herself into a thoroughly cross and disagreeable mood, and it just would not do. She got determinedly to her feet. She must go up to her room without delay and change her dress and make sure her hair was tidy. She might be a poor aging spinster with no prospects, but there was no point in being an abject one who was worthy only of pity or scorn. That would be too excruciatingly humiliating.</p><p>She hurried on her way upstairs, shaking herself free of the self-pity in which she had languished for too long. Goodness, if she hated her life so much, then it was high time she <i>did</i> something about it. The only question was <i>what</i>? Was there anything she <i>could</i> do? A woman had so few options. Sometimes, indeed, it seemed she had none at all, especially when she had a <i>past,</i> even if she was in no way to blame for any of it.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>When he found his grandmother&#x2019;s letter beside his plate at breakfast one morning along with a small pile of invitations, Ralph Stockwood, Earl of Berwick, had only recently returned to London from a three-week stay in the country.</p><p>He had come to town because at least it offered the promise of some diversion for body and mind, even if he did not expect to be vastly entertained. He would no doubt lounge about at his usual haunts in his usual aimless way for the duration of the spring Season. The whole of the beau monde had moved here too for the parliamentary session and for the frenzy of social entertainments with which it amused itself with unrelenting vigor for those few months. Ralph did not have a seat in the House of Lords, his title being a mere courtesy one, while procuring a seat in the House of Commons had never held any real appeal for him. But he always came anyway and attended as many parties and balls and concerts and the like as would alleviate the boredom of his evenings. He whiled away his days at White&#x2019;s Club and frequented Tattersall&#x2019;s to look over the horses and Jackson&#x2019;s boxing saloon to exercise his body and Manton&#x2019;s shooting gallery to maintain the steadiness of eye and hand. He spent as many hours with his tailor and his boot maker and hatmaker as were necessary to keep himself well turned out, though he had never aspired to the dandy set. He did whatever he needed to do to keep himself busy.</p><p>And he always yearned for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Well, that was the trouble. He <i>yearned,</i> but could name no object of his yearning. He had a home, Elmwood Manor, in Wiltshire, where he had grown up and that he had inherited with his title from his father. He had also inherited a perfectly competent steward who had been there forever, and therefore he did not need to spend a great deal of time there himself. He had almost sole use of his grandfather&#x2019;s lavish town house, since his grandparents scarcely came to London any longer and his mother preferred to keep her own establishment. He had fond relatives&#x2014;paternal grandparents, a maternal grandmother, a mother, three married sisters and their offspring, and some aunts, uncles, and cousins, all on his mother&#x2019;s side. He had more money than he could decently spend in one lifetime. He had&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What else did he have?</p><p>Well, he had his life. Many did not. Many who would have been his own age, that is, or younger. He was twenty-six and sometimes felt seventy. He enjoyed decent health despite the numerous scars of battle he would carry to the grave, including the one across his face. He had friends. Though that was not strictly accurate. He had numerous friendly acquaintances, but deliberately avoided forming close friendships.</p><p>Strangely, he did not usually think of his fellow Survivors as friends. They called themselves the Survivors&#x2019; Club, seven of them, six men and one woman. They had all been variously and severely wounded by the Napoleonic Wars, and they had spent a three-year period together at Penderris Hall in Cornwall, country home of George, Duke of Stanbrook, one of their number. George had not been to war himself, but his only son had died in Portugal. The duchess, the boy&#x2019;s mother, had died a few months later when she threw herself over the high cliffs at the edge of their property. George, as damaged as any of the rest of them, had opened his home as a hospital and then as a convalescent home to a group of officers. And the seven of them had stayed longer than any of the others and had formed a bond that went deeper than family, deeper even than friendship.</p><p>It was they, though, his fellow Survivors, who had caused the worse-than-usual restlessness bordering on depression he was feeling this spring. He almost welcomed his grandmother&#x2019;s letter, then. It suggested, in that way his grandmother had of making an order sound like a request, that he present himself at Manville Court without delay. He had not been there since Christmas, though he wrote dutifully every two weeks, as he did to his other grandmother. His grandfather had not been actively unwell over the holiday, but it had been apparent to Ralph that he had crossed an invisible line between elderliness and frail old age.</p><p>He guessed what the summons was all about, of course, even if his grandfather was not actually ill. The duke had no brothers, only one...</p></p><h2>A Life of Jesus</h2><p>A simple and powerful retelling of the life of Christ as seen through the eyes of a Japanese novelist.</p><p>Translated By Richard A.

How should I live? What constitutes a <i>good life</i>? What's the role of fate? What's the role of money? Is leading a <i>good life </i>a question of mindset, or is it more about reaching your goals?

Mielke is calling in a debt and wants Bernie to travel to London to poison a female agent they've both had dealings with. But Bernie isn't keen on assassinating anyone. In an attempt to dodge his Stasi handler--former Kripo comrade Friedrich Korsch--Bernie bolts for the German border. Traveling by night and hiding by day, he has plenty of time to recall the last case he and Korsch worked together...<br><br>Obersalzberg, Germany, 1939: A low-level bureaucrat has been found dead at Hitler's mountaintop retreat in Bavaria. Bernie and Korsch have one week to find the killer before the leader of the Third Reich arrives to celebrate his fiftieth birthday. Bernie knows it would mean disaster if Hitler discovers a shocking murder has been committed on the terrace of his own home. But Obersalzberg is also home to an elite Nazi community, meaning an even bigger disaster for Bernie if his investigation takes aim at one of the party's higher-ups...<br><br>1939 and 1956: two different eras about to converge in an explosion Bernie Gunther will never forget.</p><p><b>Philip Kerr</b>&nbsp;was the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of the acclaimed Bernie Gunther novels, three of which&#x2014;<i>Field Gray</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Lady from Zagreb</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Prussian Blue</i>&#x2014;were finalists for the Edgar Award for Best Novel. Kerr also won several Shamus Awards and the British Crime Writers&#x2019; Association Ellis Peters Award for Historical Crime Fiction. Just before his death in 2018, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. As P.B. Kerr, he was the author of the much-loved young adult fantasy series Children of the Lamp.one<br><br> October 1956<br><br> It was the end of the season and most of the hotels on the Riviera, including the Grand H&#x2122;tel Cap Ferrat, where I worked, were already closed for the winter. Not that winter meant much in that part of the world. Not like in Berlin, where winter is more a rite of passage than a season: you're not a true Berliner until you've survived the bitter experience of an interminable Prussian winter; that famous dancing bear you see on the city's coat of arms is just trying to keep himself warm.<br><br> The Hotel Ruhl was normally one of the last hotels in Nice to close because it had a casino and people like to gamble whatever the weather. Maybe they should have opened a casino in the nearby Hotel Negresco-which the Ruhl resembled, except that the Negresco was closed and looked as if it might stay that way the following year. Some said they were going to turn it into apartments but the Negresco concierge-who was an acquaintance of mine, and a fearful snob-said the place had been sold to the daughter of a Breton butcher, and he wasn't usually wrong about these things. He was off to Bern for the winter and probably wouldn't be back. I was going to miss him but as I parked my car and crossed the Promenade des Anglais to the Hotel Ruhl I really wasn't thinking about that. Perhaps it was the cold night air and the barman's surplus ice cubes in the gutter but instead I was thinking about Germany. Or perhaps it was the sight of the two crew-cut golems standing outside the hotel's grand Mediterranean entrance, eating ice cream cones and wearing thick East German suits of the kind that are mass-produced like tractor parts and shovels. Just seeing those two thugs ought to have put me on my guard but I had something important on my mind; I was looking forward to meeting my wife, Elisabeth, who, out of the blue, had sent me a letter inviting me to dinner. We were separated, and she was living back in Berlin, but Elisabeth's handwritten letter-she had beautiful S&#x178;tterlin handwriting (banned by the Nazis)-spoke of her having come into a bit of money, which just might have explained how she could afford to be back on the Riviera and staying at the Ruhl, which is almost as expensive as the Angleterre or the Westminster. Either way I was looking forward to seeing her again with the blind faith of one who hoped reconciliation was on the cards. I'd already planned the short but graceful speech of forgiveness I was going to make. How much I missed her and thought we could still make a go of it-that kind of thing. Of course, a part of me was also braced for the possibility she might be there to tell me she'd met someone else and wanted a divorce. Still, it seemed like a lot of trouble to go to-it wasn't easy to travel from Berlin these days.<br><br> The hotel restaurant was on the top floor in one of the corner cupolas. It was perhaps the best in Nice, designed by Charles Dalmas. Certainly it was the most expensive. I hadn't ever eaten there but I'd heard the food was excellent and I was looking forward to my dinner. The m&#x2030;itre d' sidestepped his way across the beautiful Belle Epoque room, met me at the bookings lectern, and found my wife's name on the page. I was already glancing over his shoulder, searching the tables anxiously for Elisabeth and not finding her there yet, checking my watch and realizing that I was perhaps a little early. I wasn't really listening to the m&#x2030;itre d' as he informed me that my host had arrived, and I was halfway across the marble floor when I saw I was being ushered to a quiet corner table where a squat, tough-looking man was already working on a very large lobster and a bottle of white Burgundy. Recognizing him immediately, I turned on my heel only to find my exit blocked by two more apes who looked as if they might have climbed in through the open window, off one of the many palm trees on the Promenade.<br><br> "Don't leave yet," one of them said quietly in thick, Leipzig-accented German. "The comrade-general wouldn't like it."<br><br> For a moment I stood my ground, wondering if I could risk making a run for the door. But the two men, cut from the same crude mold as the two golems I'd seen by the hotel entrance, were more than a match for me.<br><br> "That's right," added the other. "So you'd best sit down like a good boy and avoid making a scene."<br><br> "Gunther," said a voice behind me, also speaking German. "Bernhard Gunther. Come over here and sit down, you old fascist. Don't be afraid." He laughed. "I'm not going to shoot you. It's a public place." I suppose he assumed that German speakers were at a premium in the Hotel Ruhl and he probably wouldn't have been wrong. "What could possibly happen to you in here? Besides, the food is excellent and the wine more so."<br><br> I turned again and took another look at the man who remained seated and was still applying himself to the lobster with his cracker and a pick, like a plumber changing the washer on a tap. He was wearing a better suit than his men-a blue pinstripe, tailor-made-and a patterned silk tie that could only have been bought in France. A tie like that would have cost a week's wages in the GDR and probably earned you a lot of awkward questions at the local police station, as would the large gold watch that flashed on his wrist like a miniature lighthouse as he gouged at the flesh of the lobster, which was the same color as the more abundant flesh of his powerful hands. His hair was still dark on top but cut so short against the sides of his wrecking ball of a head it looked like a priest's black zucchetto. He'd put on some weight since last I'd seen him, and he hadn't even started on the new potatoes, the mayonnaise, the asparagus tips, the salade ni oise, sweet cucumber pickles, and a plate of dark chocolate arranged on the table in front of him. With his boxer's physique he reminded me strongly of Martin Bormann, Hitler's deputy chief of staff; he was certainly every bit as dangerous.<br><br> I sat down, poured myself a glass of white wine, and tossed my cigarette case onto the table in front of me.<br><br> "General Erich Mielke," I said. "What an unexpected pleasure."<br><br> "I'm sorry about bringing you here under false pretenses. But I knew you wouldn't have come if I'd said it was I who was buying dinner."<br><br> "Is she all right? Elisabeth? Just tell me that and then I'll listen to whatever you have to say, General."<br><br> "Yes, she's fine."<br><br> "I take it she's not actually here in Nice."<br><br> "No, she's not. I'm sorry about that. But you'll be glad to know that she was most reluctant to write that letter. I had to explain that the alternative would have been so much more painful, for you at least. So please don't hold that letter against her. She wrote it for the best of reasons." Mielke lifted an arm and snapped his fingers at the waiter. "Have something to eat. Have some wine. I drink very little myself but I'm told this is the best. Anything you like. I insist. The Ministry of State Security is paying. Only, please don't smoke. I hate the smell of cigarettes, especially when I'm eating."<br><br> "I'm not hungry, thanks."<br><br> "Of course you are. You're a Berliner. We don't have to be hungry to eat. The war taught us to eat when there's food on the table."<br><br> "Well, there's plenty of food on this table. Are we expecting anyone else? The Red Army, perhaps?"<br><br> "I like to see lots of food when I'm eating, even if I don't eat any of it. It's not just a man's stomach that needs filling. It's his senses, too."<br><br> I picked up the bottle and inspected the label.<br><br> "Corton-Charlemagne. I approve. Nice to see that an old communist like you can still appreciate a few of the finer things in life, General. This wine must be the most expensive on the list."<br><br> "I do, and it most certainly is."<br><br> I drained the glass and poured myself another. It was excellent.<br><br> The waiter approached nervously, as if he'd already felt the edge of Mielke's tongue.<br><br> "We'll have two juicy steaks," said Mielke, speaking good French-the result, I imagined, of his two years spent in a French prison camp before and during the war. "No, better still, we'll have the Chateaubriand. And make it very bloody."<br><br> The waiter went away.<br><br> "Is it just steak you prefer that way?" I said. "Or everything else as well?"<br><br> "Still got that sense of humor, Gunther. It beats me how you've stayed alive for this long."<br><br> "The French are a little more tolerant of these things than they are in what you laughingly call the Democratic Republic of Germany. Tell me, General, when is the communist government going to dissolve the people and elect another?"<br><br> "The people?" Mielke laughed, and breaking off from his lobster for a moment, placed a piece of chocolate into his mouth, almost as if it were a matter of indifference what he was eating just as long as it was something not easily obtained in the GDR. "They rarely know what's best for them. Nearly fourteen million Germans voted for Hitler in March 1932, making the Nazis the largest party in the Reichstag. Do you honestly believe they had a clue what was best for them? No, of course not. Nobody did. All the people care about is a regular pay packet, cigarettes, and beer."<br><br> "I expect that's why twenty thousand East German refugees were crossing into the Federal Republic every month-at least until you imposed your so-called special regime with its restricted zone and your protective strip. They were in search of better beer and cigarettes and perhaps the chance to complain a little without fear of the consequences."<br><br> "Who was it said that none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who believe they are free?"<br><br> "It was Goethe. And you misquote him. He said that none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free."<br><br> "In my book, they are one and the same."<br><br> "That would be the one book you've read, then."<br><br> "You're a romantic fool. I forget that about you, sometimes. Look, Gunther, most people's idea of freedom is to write something rude on a lavatory wall. My own belief is that the people are lazy and prefer to leave the business of government to the government. However, it's important that the people don't place too great a burden on those in charge of things. Hence, my presence here in France. Generally speaking I prefer to go hunting. But I often come here around this time of year to get away from my responsibilities. I like to play a little baccarat."<br><br> "That's a high-risk game. But then you always were a gambler."<br><br> "You want to know the really great thing about gambling here?" He grinned. "Most of the time, I lose. If there were still such decadent things as casinos in the GDR I'm afraid the croupiers would always make sure I won. Winning is only fun if you can lose. I used to go to the one in Baden-Baden but the last time I was there I was recognized and couldn't go again. So now I come to Nice. Or sometimes Le Touquet. But I prefer Nice. The weather is a little more reliable here than on the Atlantic coast."<br><br> "Somehow I don't believe that's all you're here for."<br><br> "You're right."<br><br> "So what the hell do you want?"<br><br> "You remember that business a few months back, with Somerset Maugham and our mutual friends Harold Hennig and Anne French. You almost managed to screw up a good operation there."<br><br> Mielke was referring to a Stasi plot to discredit Roger Hollis, the deputy director of MI5-the British domestic counterintelligence and security agency. The real plan had been to leave Hollis smelling of roses after the bogus Stasi plot was revealed.<br><br> "It was very good of you to tie up that loose end for us," said Mielke. "It was you who killed Hennig, wasn't it?"<br><br> I didn't answer but we both knew this was true; I'd shot Harold Hennig dead in the house Anne French had been renting in Villefranche and done my very best to frame her for it. Since then the French police had asked me all sorts of questions about her, but that was all I knew. As far as I was aware, Anne French remained safely back in England.<br><br> "Well, for the sake of argument, let's just say it was you," said Mielke. He finished the piece of chocolate he was eating, forked some pickled cucumber into his mouth, and then swallowed a mouthful of white Burgundy, all of which persuaded me that his taste buds were every bit as corrupt as his politics and morals. "The fact is that Hennig's days were numbered anyway. As are Anne's. The operation to discredit Hollis really only looks good if we try to eliminate her, too-as befits someone who betrayed us. And that's especially important now that the French are trying to have her extradited back here to face trial for Hennig's murder. Needless to say, that just can't be allowed to happen. Which is where you come in, Gunther."<br><br> "Me?" I shrugged. "Let me get this straight. You're asking me to kill Anne French?"<br><br> "Precisely. Except that I'm not asking. The fact is that you agreeing to kill Anne French is a condition of remaining alive yourself."<br><br> Two<br><br> October 1956<br><br> I estimated once that the Gestapo had employed less than fifty thousand officers to keep an eye on eighty million Germans, but from what I'd read and heard about the GDR, the Stasi employed at least twice that number-to say nothing of their civilian informants or spylets who, rumor had it, amounted to one in ten of the population-to keep an eye on just seventeen million Germans. As deputy head of the Stasi, Erich Mielke was one of the most powerful men in the GDR. And as might have been expected of such a man, he'd already anticipated all my objections to such a distasteful mission as the one he had described and was ready to argue them down with the brute force of one who is used to getting his way with people who are themselves authoritarian and assertive. I had the feeling that Mielke might have grabbed me by the throat or banged my head on the dinner table and, of course, violence was a vital part of his character; as a young communist cadre in Berlin he'd participated in the infamous murder of two uniformed policemen.</p><h2>Prince of Cats</h2><p>PRINCE OF CATS is the B side to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, played at an eighties block party in a NY where underground sword dueling blossomed alongside hip-hop, punk, disco, and no wave.

Written by eminent Old Testament scholar Bruce Waltke, this two-volume commentary is unquestionably the most comprehensive work on Proverbs available.<br><br>Grounded in the new literary criticism that has so strengthened biblical interpretation of late, Waltke's commentary on Proverbs demonstrates the profound, ongoing relevance of this Old Testament book for Christian faith and life. A thorough introduction addresses such issues as text and versions, structure, authorship, and theology. The detailed commentary itself explains and elucidates Proverbs as "theological literature." Waltke's highly readable style -- evident even in his original translation of the Hebrew text -- makes his scholarly work accessible to teachers, pastors, Bible students, and general readers alike.</p><p>Bruce K.

It is a story of all Europe, of Nazis and their allies, the experience of wartime occupation, the suffering and strategies of marked victims, the failure of international rescue, and the success of individual rescuers. It alone in Holocaust literature negotiates the chasm between the two histories, that of the perpetrators and of the victims and their families, shining new light on German actions and Jewish reactions.<br><br> No other book in any language has so embraced this multifaceted story. <em>Holocaust</em> uniquely makes use of oral histories recorded by the authors over fifteen years across Europe and the United States, as well as never-before-analyzed archival documents, letters, and diaries; it contains in addition seventy-five illustrations and sixteen original maps, each accompanied by an extended caption. This book is an original analysis of a defining event. 14 maps, 75 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Deb�rah Dwork</strong> is the director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University.

And yet few people understand, and many assume incorrectly, what sort of man he was. How did the illegitimate son of a French sea captain living in Haiti, who lied both about his parentage and his training, rise to become one of <i>the</i> greatest natural historians ever and the greatest name in ornithology? In <i>Under a Wild Sky</i> this Pulitzer Prize finalist, William Souder reveals that Audubon did not only compose the most famous depictions of birds the world has ever seen, he also composed a brilliant mythology of self. In this dazzling work of biography, Souder charts the life of a driven man who, despite all odds, became the historical figure we know today.<br></p><p>William Souder is the author of three books, including "Under a Wild Sky" and "On a Farther Shore: The Life and Legacy of Rachel Carson." He lives in Grant, MN.<br>Renowned for his knowledge of the American wilderness, John James Audubon (1785&#x2013;1851) was equally adept at the quintessential American activity of self-invention. Arriving in New York City in 1803, the 18-year-old native of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) and illegitimate son of a French sea captain passed himself off as the Louisiana-born scion of a French admiral and claimed to have studied painting with the European master Jacques-Louis David. Audubon (even the name was false) came to the United States to manage a small estate his father co-owned near Philadelphia. Unsuccessful, he eventually tried his hand as a shopkeeper and a mill owner, but failed there, too. His passion for hunting&#x2014;and for making life-size, realistically posed paintings of the animals he shot&#x2014;led to the creation of his magnum opus, <i>Birds of America</i>, now one of the most admired works of American art. But this monumental venture was fraught with difficulties that sometimes brought the artist near the brink of despair. Audubon's work was initially scorned in the U.S.; he had to travel through Britain and France to arouse enough interest to fund the project. Even after its completion and its enthusiastic reception in Europe and the U.S., the work left the naturalist with only a modest income for a lifetime of effort. Souder (<i>A Plague of Frogs</i>) presents Audubon as a complex individual: a loving but distracted husband; a driven artist often plagued by doubts; a scrupulous observer of nature who thought nothing of fabricating some of his written material for dramatic effect. Sympathetic yet balanced, this account shows how much Audubon was shaped by the deep paradoxes of the time and place in which he lived.

Carefully chosen for kids, these 35 poems are presented, illustrated, and explained by an expert.</b><br><br> There is no better time to introduce children to poetry and literature than during their<b> formative years</b>. That is why professor and scholar Kate Benzel has used her wealth of experience to&nbsp;carefully curate&nbsp;35 of Carl Sandburg's luminary poems into one <b>collection that is specially designed for children</b>.<br><br> In&nbsp;<i>Poetry for Kids:&nbsp;Carl Sandburg</i>&nbsp;you'll find many&nbsp;classics, some of which you may remember from your childhood,&nbsp;including "<b>Young Bullfrogs</b>," "<b>Shenandoah</b>", "<b>Jazz Fantasia</b>",&nbsp;"<b>Fog</b>", and 31&nbsp;more of Sandburg's favorite and most accessible works. Accompanying the words are<b>&nbsp;beautifully illustrated scenes</b>&nbsp;by&nbsp;award-winning illustrator Robert Crawford.&nbsp;This gentle introduction<b> includes commentary</b>, <b>definitions </b>of key words, and an <b>introduction to the poet's life</b>, plus a final synopsis of the author's interpretation of the pieces.</p></p><p><p><b>Carl Sandburg</b> was an American poet, biographer, and editor who won three Pulitzer Prizes (two for his poetry). Three of his most famous volumes of poetry include <i>Chicago Poems</i>, <i>Cornhuskers</i>, and <i>Smoke and Steel</i>. His poems are accessible and incredibly visual.</p><p><b>Kate Benzel, PhD,</b> is a Carl Sandburg scholar and professor emerita at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, where she is currently transcribing and annotating Sandburg's early unpublished notebooks.</p><p><b>Robert Crawford</b> is an illustrator and fine artist living in the northwest hills of Connecticut. He works in his own unique style, which he says influenced is by magic realism and the regionalism of post-World War II artists like Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton. His work has been on the cover of major magazines, including <i>Fortune, Business Week, The Atlantic</i> and <i>U.S. News and World Report, Newsweek</i> and <i>Rolling Stone.</i> He has also illustrated four children's books, including <i>T Is for Taj Mahal: An India Alphabet</i> and <i>The Legend of the Old Man of the Mountain</i>.</p>Gr 3 Up&#x2014;This addition to the series, which began with Emily Dickinson, showcases the poetry of Carl Sandburg, the singing bard of America. Arranged in two categories, poems about people and places, the 36 free verse selections follow a brief biographical introduction by Benzel, who is noted for her work on the Sandburg Project: Prayers for the People. Acrylic illustrations are paired with the poems and are most effective when portraying the natural world. Least successful are Crawford's simplistic renderings, such as the letters that spell out the word soup in a bowl of broth, which accompany the poem of the same name. While much of the artwork is stunning, it depicts the surface layer of the poems without revealing any of the subtle imagery beneath. Many of Sandburg's classic poems, such as "Fog" and "Jazz Fantasia," can be found here. More complex pieces such as "Psalm of Those Who Go Forth Before Daylight" and "Sunset from Omaha Hotel Window" have been chosen instead of delightful nonsense poems such as "We Must Be Polite" or "Arithmetic," which seems odd in a volume meant for kids. Poetry for Young People: Carl Sandburg, edited by Frances Schoonmaker Bolin, is a more comprehensive overview that features some of Sandburg's nonsense poetry. Benzel's book is best suited for reading aloud. A table of contents and an index of first lines are also included.

His argument is a response to the atheist culture that is now growing around us, and also a defence of human uniqueness. He rebuts the claim that there is no meaning or purpose in the natural world, and argues that the sacred and the transcendental are 'real presences', through which human beings come to know themselves and to find both their freedom and their redemption.</p><p>In the human face we find a paradigm of meaning. And from this experience, Scruton argues, we both construct the face of the world, and address the face of God. We find in the face both the proof of our freedom and the mark of self-consciousness. One of the motivations of the atheist culture is to escape from the eye of judgement. You escape from the eye of judgement by blotting out the face: and this, Scruton argues, is the most disturbing aspect of the times in which we live. In his wide-ranging argument Scruton explains the growing sense of destruction that we feel, as the habits of pleasure seeking and consumerism deface the world. His book defends a consecrated world against the habit of desecration, and offers a vision of the religious way of life in a time of trial.</p></p><p>Atheist culture involves a turning away from God. Scruton shows how self-destructive this is for us and our culture.<p>Roger Scruton is visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, Senior Research Fellow at Blackfriars Hall Oxford and visiting Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews.</p></p><h2>Youth Ministry Management Tools 2.0: Everything You Need to Successfully Manage Your Ministry</h2><p><p>Youth ministry isn&#x2019;t just meeting with students and teaching them God&#x2019;s truth.&nbsp; It also involves a myriad of administrative and operational details.&nbsp; <em>Youth Ministry Management Tools 2.0&nbsp;</em>provides youth ministers and volunteers with helpful insights, advice, and practical resources to successfully manage a youth ministry.&nbsp; You&#x2019;ll find sample budgets, release forms for trips, and clear direction for screening applicants for volunteer positions.

"Lovely out, isn't it?" He smiles pleasantly, and my insides clench.<br><br>"Good morning, Father Tim. What can I get for you today?"<br><br>"I think I'll be tryin' your French toast, shall I? Brilliant idea, the almond glaze."<br><br>That brogue is just not fair. "Thanks. I'll get that right in." <em>I've had sinful thoughts about you. Again.</em> I wrack my brain for something to say.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on my homily any time."<br><br>Father Tim often urges me to drop by. Something stops me. Guilt, no doubt.

He looks ridiculously appealing in black, though granted, the white collar takes away some of the zing. Rolling my eyes at my own ridiculous thoughts, I turn away, fill a few coffee cups and slip into the kitchen, where Octavio is deftly flipping pancakes. "French toast for Father Tim," I tell him, grabbing an order of eggs on unbuttered toast. Returning to the counter area, I slide the plate in front of Stuart, one of my regulars. "Chicks on a raft, high and dry," I say. He nods appreciatively, a big fan of diner slang.<br><br>"Anything else for you, Mrs. Jensen?" I ask the seventy-year-old woman in the first booth.

"True enough, but being the best-kept secret on coastal Maine isn't doing us much good financially."<br><br>"We'll be fine," he assures me. Easy for him to say. He makes more than I do, and he doesn't have to balance the books every month.<br><br>"Hey, Maggie, as long as you're up, can I get a refill?" asks Judy, my waitress.

Judy came with the diner. She's somewhere between sixty and one hundred and twenty, gifted at not working, though when pressed, she can handle a full diner, not that we get that a lot. Georgie gets some help in the summer, when we hire a high school kid to deal with the light tourist business that makes it this far north.<br><br>And there's me, of course. I cook the daily specials, do all the baking, wait tables, balance the books, maintain the inventory and keep the place clean. Our final, though unofficial, employee is Colonel. My dog. My buddy. My precious boy. "Who's your mommy?" I ask him. "Huh, Colonel McKissy? Who loves you, pretty boy?" His tail thumps at my idiot talk, but he knows not to leave his place behind the register. A Golden Retriever takes up a lot of room, but most people don't even see Colonel, who has nicer manners than the queen of England. At thirteen, he's mellow, but he's always been incredibly well-behaved. I give him a piece of bacon and get back to work.<br><br>Father Tim rises to settle his check. "Hello, Gwen, love, how are you today? Don't you look smart in that lovely shade of yellow," he says to Mrs. Jensen, who simpers in pleasure. He smiles at me, and my knees soften. "I'll see you both tonight, won't I?"<br><br>"That's right," I answer. I may not be able to bring myself to Mass, but Father Tim has worn me down for Bible study. I stifle the urge to shake my head at myself. Bible study. My social plans for the week. Well, it's not like I'm turning away dozens of suitors. Sadly, Father Tim is closer to a boyfriend than anything I've had in some time.<br><br>"Nancy Ringley's bringing the snack?" Father Tim frowns.<br><br>"No." I smile. "I am. Her daughter's under the weather, so she called me."<br><br>His face lights up. "Ah, wonderful! About the snack, at any rate. Not her dear little daughter. I'll see you later, then, Maggie." He pats my shoulder with avuncular affection, causing lust and exhilaration to flow down my arm, and turns for the door. <em>I love you,</em> I mouth. I can't help myself.<br><br>Did he hear me? My face flushes in mortification as Father Tim glances back at me with a smile and a wink before going out into the cold. He waves as he crosses the street, ever kind where I'm concerned. Mrs. Jensen, who is not so tolerant, glares at me. I narrow my eyes in return. She doesn't fool me. We suffer from the same disease&#x2014;I'm just a little more obvious.<br><br>It's a frigid March day, the wind howling off the water, slicing through the thickest wool hats and mi-crofiber gloves. Only a few brave souls venture out, and the day drags. We don't get more than a handful of people at lunch. I wait for Judy to finish her crossword puzzle before sending her home, as she's really only here for show, anyway. Octavio takes off his apron as I scrape the grill.<br><br>"Tavy, take the rest of the pie, okay? Your kids will like it," I tell him. He has five children.<br><br>"They will if they get to taste it. I already had two pieces." Octavio grins his engaging gap-tooth smile.<br><br>I grin back. "Did Judy get any more ballots?"<br><br>"I think she gave out a few."<br><br>"Great." I've been relentless in asking my patrons to fill them out. Last year we lost by two hundred votes, so I need every one who crosses the threshold to pitch in. "Have a nice afternoon, Octavio," I say.<br><br>"You, too, boss."<br><br>"Here, take these cookies, too." My cook grins his thanks, then goes out the back door.<br><br>Colonel knows what time it is. He gets up from his spot and comes over to me for a little pat, pushing his big head against my thighs. I stroke his white cheeks. "You're such a good boy, aren't you?" He wags in agreement, then returns to his spot, knowing I'll be a while yet.<br><br>I flip the Open sign to Closed and wipe down the last table. This is one of my favorite times of day...three o'clock. We're done for the day. Joe's opens at six, though I usually don't roll in until seven (the joys of ownership), but I make up my time by doing all the baking each afternoon. I'm proud to say that Joe's desserts are locally famous, especially the pies and coconut macaroons.<br><br>Joe's is a Jerry Mahoney design. Red-and-cream porcelain with stainless steel siding on the outside, red vinyl seats, cream-colored walls and a black-and-white tile floor on the inside. Ten swivel stools are bolted to the floor at the counter. At one end is the requisite pastry display case where my sweets tempt the patrons. There are seven booths with nice deep backs and seats that are just bouncy enough. At some point, my grandfather had those little jukeboxes installed and, as kids, we loved flipping through to see what the new selections were. The kitchen is through a swinging door with a porthole, and there's a tiny supply room and unisex bathroom. In the corner window, a neon sign blinks those timeless words, Eat at Joe's.<br><br>For the next half hour, I add up the receipts, check the inventory, print out more ballots and mop the floor. I play the jukeboxes as I work, singing along with Aretha and the Boss. Finally, I go back into the kitchen and start baking the desserts for tomorrow. And the snack for tonight.<br><br>Since Father Tim's face brightened when he heard I was on snack duty, I decide to do something special. In the tiny kitchen, I take out the necessary ingredients and set about making apricot squares, one of his favorites. Once those are in the oven, I roll out a few pie crusts and throw together a couple of blueberry pies.<br><br>Colonel's tail starts thumping, and I hear him scramble to get up off the tile floor. I reduce the heat on the pies and move them to a higher shelf so the bottom crusts won't burn. Without checking, I know my sister is about to come in.<br><br>I'm right, as I usually am about Christy. She's just pulling the baby stroller in through the door. We haven't seen each other for three entire days, which is a long spell when it comes to us. "Hey, Christy." I smile, holding the door for her.<br><br>"Hey, Mags," she answers. She glances at me, then does a double take. "Oh, for God's sake." She wrestles the carriage the rest of the way in, Violet sleeping undisturbed, and pulls off her hat. "Me, too."<br><br>My mouth drops open. "Christy!" We start laughing simultaneously, reaching for each other's hands at the same moment.<br><br>Christy and I are identical twins. And we are quite identical still, though Christy had a baby eight months ago. We weigh exactly the same, have the same bra size, shoe size, pants size. We each have a mole on our left cheeks. We both have a slightly crooked pinky on our right hands. Though Christy dresses a little better than I do, most people can't tell us apart. In fact, only Will, Christy's husband, has never once confused us. Even our parents goof once in a while, and, Jonah, who is younger by eight years, doesn't try awfully hard to distinguish us.<br><br>We often call each other only to get a busy signal because the other had the same thought at the same moment. Sometimes we get each other the same birthday card or pick out the same sweater from the L.L.<br><br>Bean catalog. If I buy tulips for my kitchen table, it's a good bet that Christy has done the same thing.<br><br>But once in a while, in order to create some sense of individuality, one of us will get the urge to try something new. And so, on Monday when the diner was closed, I went to Jonesport and got my hair layered a little, had a few highlights put in. Apparently Christy had the same thought. Once more, we are identical.<br><br>"When did you get yours done?" I ask.<br><br>"Yesterday. You?" She smiles as she reaches out to touch my new 'do.<br><br>"Monday, so the haircut is really mine." I grin as I say it. I don't mind. In fact, I've always kind of liked being mistaken for Christy. "I wear mine in a ponytail most of the time, anyway," I say. "Plus, you have better clothes."<br><br>"Unstained, anyway," she smiles, sitting at the counter. She takes off her coat and drapes it over the next stool. I go over to the stroller, which is one of those complicated Swedish affairs with everything from a wind guard to a cappuccino maker, and twist my head inside. Stretching my lips, I can just about kiss my sleeping niece. "Hello, angel," I whisper, worshiping her perfect skin and feathery eyelashes. "God, Christy, she gets more beautiful every day."<br><br>"I know," Christy answers smugly. "So what's new?"<br><br>"Oh, not much. Father Tim was in. I think he may have heard me tell him I love him."<br><br>"Oh, Maggie." Christy chuckles sympathetically. She knows better than to spout the platitudes that everyone else does... <em>Why are you wasting your time on a priest? Can't you find somebody else? You really should meet someone, Maggie. Have you tried the Internet/volunteering/church/dating services/speed dating/singles clubs/singles nights/singles cruises/prostitution?</em> (This last one was suggested by my brother's friend Stevie, who has been hitting on me since he was twelve years old.)<br><br>I've tried volunteering. And church, of course, contains the root of my problem. But singles nights and those speed dating things... Well, first of all, we don't have much of that in rural Maine. The nearest big city is Bar Harbor, and that's at least an hour and a half south, if the weather is clear. As for the Internet, those services smack of deceit. A person could say anything, after all. What better way to lie about yourself? How many stories have I heard about a person being sorely disappointed by his or her Internet date? So, while there may be merit in that venue, I've never tried it.<br><br></p><h2>Redirect</h2><p><b>"There are few academics who write with as much grace and wisdom as Timothy Wilson.

For each question, there is a concise explanation of how to apply it in the evaluation of research reports. Numerous examples from journals in the social and behavioral sciences illustrate the application of the evaluation questions, and demonstrate actual examples of strong and weak features of published reports. Common-sense models for evaluation combined with a lack of jargon make it possible for students to start evaluating research articles the first week of class. </p> <p></p><b> <p>New to this edition</p> </b><ul><b></b> <p> </p><li>New chapters on:</li> <p></p> <ul> <p> </p><li>evaluating mixed methods research </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>evaluating systematic reviews and meta-analyses</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>program evaluation research</li> <p></p></ul> <p> </p><li>Updated chapters and appendices that provide more comprehensive information and recent examples</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Full new online resources: test bank questions and PowerPoint slides for instructors, and self-test chapter quizzes, further readings and additional journal examples for students.</li></ul></p><p><p><strong>Maria Tcherni-Buzzeo</strong> is an Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of New Haven.

By the end of the century, however, nearly all of these peoples had become citizens of independent nation-states. The United Nations grew from 51 member states at its founding in 1945 to 193 today. Its nearly four-fold increase is one measure of the historic shift in international relations that has occurred over the past half-century. Decolonization is the term commonly used to refer to this transition from a world of colonial empires to a world of nation-states in the years after World War II.<br><br>Both ex-imperial states and post-colonial regimes have promoted a selective and sanitized version of decolonization that casts their own conduct in a positive light, characterizing the process as negotiated and the outcome as inevitable. This book draws on recent scholarship to challenge that view, demonstrating that considerable violence and instability accompanied the end of empire and that the outcome was often up for grabs.<br><br>This book highlights three themes. The first is that global war between empires precipitated decolonization, creating the economic and political crises that gave colonial subjects the opportunity to seek independence. The second theme is that nation-state was not the only option pursued by anti-colonial activists. Many of them sought pan- and trans-national polities instead, but a combination of international and institutional pressures made the nation-state the standard template. The third theme is that the struggle to escape imperial subjugation and create nation-states generated widespread violence and produced huge refugee populations, leading to political problems that persist to the present day. By focusing on these crucial points, Dane Kennedy reminds us how the tumultuous, even tragic, changes caused by the decolonization profoundly shaped the world we live in.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dane Kennedy</strong> is the Elmer Louis Kayser Professor of History and International Affairs at George Washington University and the Director of the National History Center.

Such a shame her career ended so early, all because of that accident. They say it was her sister, Jane, who did it--that she crashed the car because she was drunk. They say that's why she looks after Blanche now, because of the guilt. That's what they say, at least.<br><br>Nobody remembers that Jane was once a star herself. A fixture of early vaudeville, Baby Jane Hudson performed her song and dance routines for adoring crowds until a move to Hollywood thrust her sister into the spotlight. Even now, years later, Jane dreams of reviving her act. But as the lines begin to blur between fantasy and reality, past resentments become dangerous--and the sisters' long-kept secrets threaten to destroy them. <br><br><strong>Now with three short stories available for the first time in print, including <em>What Ever Happened to Cousin Charlotte</em>, the basis for the film <em>Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte</em>.</strong><br></p><p>Henry Farrell was a novelist and screenwriter. His most well-known work was the acclaimed gothic horror novel WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?, which was first released in 1960 and later adapted into a film starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Mr. Farrell passed away in 2006.Before this tale of two sisters locked in the ultimate sibling rivalry became the hit 1962 movie starring Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, it was a novel by Farrell (1920&#x2013;2006) written because he needed a commercial success to pay for his wife's medical bills. As readers can see from this reissue, the original 1960 novel&#x2014;about a former vaudevillian child star, Baby Jane Hudson, who torments her wheelchair-bound sister, Blanche, who was once a glamorous movie star&#x2014;has a deep layer of psychological suspense that's obscured in the campy film. Farrell delves into Baby Jane's psyche, showing a woman mourning her childhood success and stymied by her inability to act on her emotional needs. A foreword by Farrell's literary agent, Mitch Douglas, features gossipy tidbits about the Davis-Crawford rivalry. Three short stories, including the wryly entertaining What Ever Happened to Charlotte?, which inspired the film Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte, round out the volume.

Fiendishly intricate cases were particularly well suited to the cerebral type of detective story that became so popular during the 'golden age of murder' between the two world wars. But the tradition goes back to the days of Edgar Allan Poe and Wilkie Collins, and impossible crime stories have been written by such luminaries as Arthur Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton, Dorothy L. Sayers and Margery Allingham.</p><p>This anthology celebrates their work, alongside long-hidden gems by less familiar writers. Together these stories demonstrate the range and high accomplishment of the classic British impossible crime story over more than half a century.</p></p><p><p><strong>MARTIN EDWARDS</strong> is an award-winning crime writer best known for two series of novels set in Liverpool and the Lake District. He is a series consultant for British Library Crime Classics, Chair of the Crime Writers' Association, and President of the Detection Club. <em>The Golden Age of Murder</em>, his study of the Detection Club, was published in 2015 to international acclaim, and won the Edgar, Agatha, H.R.F. Keating and Macavity awards for the year's best book about the genre.</p>"Another great collection of short stories by British writers ranging in date from Conan Doyle to Margery Allingham. It pleased me that the stories varied in length and difficulty of solution. Very highly recommended for all fans of classic British detection." (Eric Bruce <i><b>Goodreads</b></i>)<br><br>"I am a avid crime fiction fan. Especially ones from the Golden Era... I absolutely loved every word, every mystery. every twist and turn." (Sarah Marsden <i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br>"Martin Edwards, who is, among other things, the president of England's prestigious Detection Club, has been kept quite busy of late collecting short stories by classic authors and putting them together into anthologies. As I am particularly fond of stories in the "impossible crimes" sub-genre, I am most grateful for this latest anthology which focuses its attention entirely upon impossibilities. Edwards has chosen from a good mix of authors - some quite famous, some who have lapsed into obscurity. All have turned out wonderfully tricky stories about impossible crimes, and the solutions, in general, are quite novel." (Les Blatt <i><b><i>Classic Mysteries</i></b></i>)<br><br>"The stories are described as 'the cr�me de la cr�me' of Impossible crimes and locked room mysteries... and the introduction by Martin Edwards are really interesting and add a great deal to the book. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys the older style of writing."

This is remarkable debut by a splendid young writer.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Robert Olen Butler, Pulitzer Prize winning author of <i>A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;In this bold and surprising debut novel, Tiffany McDaniel reveals a new voice in contemporary fiction. At times comic, at times heartbreaking, <i>The Summer That Melted Everything</i>, moves between the future and the past, and gives us a window on a particular time, the hell-hot summer of 1984, and a group of characters George Orwell could not have imagined. In this world nothing is quite what it seems, as mystery and revelation alternate, right up to the end. At times surreal, magical, this story of a family and community incorporates global warming, AIDS, discrimination, fear, mass hysteria, lynching, and martyrdom, but in the end is a love story, warning us not to be too quick in judging what is evil and what is good.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Robert Morgan, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Gap Creek</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes there is a novel so strange and beguiling it makes you give up your world for another world, all the while that you are reading it.

It will frighten you, and charm you, and break your heart if you allow it . . . and you will allow it, because once this world has hold of you, it won&#x2019;t let you go.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Jacquelyn Mitchard, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author <i>The Deep End of the Ocean</i> and <i>Two if by Sea</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i></b>&#x201c;Tiffany McDaniel&#x2019;s brilliant literary debut is a feast for the mind.

You'll not read anything else like it.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;James Sie, author of <i>Still Life Las Vegas</i></b></p></p><h2>Wife Mother &amp; Mystic</h2><p>The story of Blessed Anna-Maria Taigi, a woman singled out at the age of twenty-one, to receive revelations from Our Lord and the Blessed Mother, which continued until her death. In her visions she foresaw much of the political turmoil that took place during her life most significantly the French Revolution and subsequent weakening of the Church&#39;s temporal authority. She also read the state of souls, both living and dead. Despite these miraculous gifts, she was content to fulfill her station in life as the wife of a poor serving-man and the mother of seven children. Wife, Mother and Mystic chronicles the events of an extraordinary life and yet, the great lesson of this biography is not found in the extraordinary, but in this modest woman&#39;s constant, hidden &#34;striving after holiness&#34; in her most ordinary tasks.</p><p>The Rev. Father Albert Bessieres, S.J., was a Jesuit priest and author of the twentieth century. His <i>Wife, Mother and Mystic: Blessed Anna-Maria Taigi</i> records the various events of the titular holy woman's extraordinary and miraculous life, in an edition translated by the Rev. Stephen Rigby. Father Bessieres' work, edited by Douglas Newton, was originally published by Sands &amp; Company, London, in 1952. It has since been reprinted several times by TAN, beginning in 1970, with the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur.</p><h2>Unsettling America: An Anthology of Contemporary Multicultural Poetry</h2><p><b>A multicultural array of poets explore what it is means to be American&nbsp;</b><br><br>This powerful and moving collection of poems stretches across the boundaries of skin color, language, ethnicity, and religion to give voice to the lives and experiences of ethnic Americans.

At thirty, the author was at Bill Clinton's side during the presidential campaign of 1992, &amp; for the next five years he was rarely more than a step away from the president &amp; his other advisers at every important moment of the first term. What Liar's Poker did to Wall Street, this book will do to politics. It is an irreverent &amp; intimate portrait of how the nation's weighty business is conducted by people whose egos &amp; idiosyncrasies are no sturdier than anyone else's. Including sharp portraits of the Clintons, Al Gore, Dick Morris, Colin Powell, &amp; scores of others, as well as candid &amp; revelatory accounts of the famous debacles &amp; triumphs of an administration that constantly went over the top, All Too Human is, like its author, a brilliant combination of pragmatic insight &amp; idealism. It is destined to be the most important &amp; enduring book to come out of the Clinton administration.</p><p>A Rhodes scholar with a healthy ego, the young idealist George Stephanopoulos thought he was ready for the obscure governor of Arkansas. But soon after he signed on as his presidential-campaign manager, the odds of Clinton's triumph soared, and so did the chance for calamity via Gennifer Flowers and other scandals. Stephanopoulos scrambled behind the scenes, squelching rumors, spinning major news organizations, artfully knifing Clinton rivals, and second-guessing public opinion--lessons that would serve him well when Clinton won.<p> For the next four years, Stephanopoulos was a few feet from the president, advising him on everything from Iraq and Waco to gays in the military and Paula Jones. More than any book yet--including Monica Lewinsky's--Stephanopoulos's memoir reveals what went on in the scary, occasionally hilarious world backstage at the White House. He casts stark light on characters from Yeltsin, "like a boiled potato slathered in sour cream," to the author's nemesis Dick Morris, whom he depicts bellowing for Clinton to bomb Bosnia. And nobody who's talking knows as well as Stephanopoulos the most passionate, mystifying affair of all, between Bill and Hillary.</p><p> But years of backroom scheming, screaming, and relentless political attacks took a toll. Stephanopoulos's face erupted in hives; he grew a beard. Slammed by clinical depression, he dangerously delayed medical attention, fearing the story might leak. This memoir could've been titled <i>Prisoner of Spin</i>. Written with the jittery cadence of a bookie, <i>All Too Human</i> is a lively look at the complex and motley cast of characters who rule the world. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>George Stephanopoulos is currently a visiting professor at Columbia University.</p><h2>Gettysburg&#x2019;s Peach Orchard: Longstreet, Sickles, and the Bloody Fight for the &#x201c;Commanding Ground&#x201d; Along the Emmitsburg Road</h2><p>More books have been written about the battle of Gettysburg than any other engagement of the Civil War. The historiography of the battle&#x2019;s second day is usually dominated by the Union&#x2019;s successful defense of Little Round Top, but the day&#x2019;s most influential action occurred nearly one mile west along the Emmitsburg Road in farmer Joseph Sherfy&#x2019;s peach orchard. Despite its overriding importance, no full-length study of this pivotal action has been written until now. James Hessler&#x2019;s and Britt Isenberg&#x2019;s Gettysburg&#x2019;s Peach Orchard: Longstreet, Sickles, and the Bloody Fight for the &#x201c;Commanding Ground&#x201d; Along the Emmitsburg Road corrects that oversight.<br><br>On July 2, 1863, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee ordered skeptical subordinate Lt. Gen.&nbsp;James Longstreet to launch a massive assault against the Union left flank. The offensive was intended to seize the Peach Orchard and surrounding ground along the Emmitsburg Road for use as an artillery position to support the ongoing attack. However, Union Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles, a scheming former congressman from New York, misinterpreted his orders and occupied the orchard first.<br><br>What followed was some of Gettysburg&#x2019;s bloodiest and most controversial fighting. General Sickles&#x2019;s questionable advance forced Longstreet&#x2019;s artillery and infantry to fight for every inch of ground to Cemetery Ridge. The Confederate attack crushed the Peach Orchard salient and other parts of the Union line, threatening the left flank of Maj. Gen. George Meade&#x2019;s army. The command decisions made in and around the Sherfy property influenced actions on every part of the battlefield. The occupation of the high ground at the Peach Orchard helped General Lee rationalize ordering the tragic July 3 assault known as &#x201c;Pickett&#x2019;s Charge.&#x201d;<br><br>This richly detailed study is based upon scores of primary accounts and a deep understanding of the terrain. Hessler and Isenberg, both Gettysburg Licensed Battlefield Guides, combine the military aspects of the fighting with human interest stories in a balanced treatment of the bloody attack and defense of Gettysburg&#x2019;s Peach Orchard.</p><p>James A. Hessler is a Licensed Battlefield Guide at Gettysburg. He is the award-winning author of Sickles at Gettysburg (Savas Beatie, 2009), the recipient of the Bachelder Coddington Award and Gettysburg Civil War Round Table Distinguished Book Award, and co-author of Pickett&#x2019;s Charge at Gettysburg (Savas Beatie, 2015). His media appearances include Travel Channel, NPR, PCN-TV, Breitbart News, Civil War Radio, and Gettysburg Daily. He was a primary content designer for the Civil War Trust&#x2019;s mobile Gettysburg application and has written several articles for publication. He lives with his wife and family in Gettysburg.<br><br>Britt C. Isenberg is a full-time Licensed Battlefield Guide at Gettysburg National Military Park since 2014. He has been published in several Civil War periodicals through writing and photography, and is the author of The Boys Fought Like Demons (2016), a regimental history of the 105th Pennsylvania Infantry. His tours at Gettysburg have also been featured on PCN-TV. Originally from Millersburg, PA, he resides with his wife and daughter near Gettysburg.Enhanced with the inclusion of an informative introduction (A Fatal Mistake), photographs, illustrations, and Appendix (Select Order of Battle), a twenty-four page Bibliography, and an eleven page Index, "Gettysburg's Peach Orchard: Longstreet, Sickles, and the Bloody Fight for the "Commanding Ground" Along the Emmitsburg Road" is an impressively informative and exceptionally well presented study that is very highly recommended as a core addition to personal, community, and academic library American Civil War military history collections and supplemental curriculum studies lists.

Organized alphabetically by manufacturer, this book includes every type of aircraft, from fighters to seaplanes, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, torpedo bombers and carrier aircraft. All the best-known types are featured, such as the Mitsubishi G4M &#x2018;Betty&#x2019;, Nakajima B6N2 Tenzan, Aichi B7A2 Ryusei torpedo bomber and the world- famous Mitsubishi A6M &#x2018;Zero&#x2019; fighter. The entries are accompanied by exhaustive captions and specifications. The guide is illustrated with profile artworks, three-views, and special cutaway artworks of the more famous aircraft in service, such as the Aichi D3A1 &#x2018;Val&#x2019;, Mitsubishi A6M2 Reisen, and Nakajima Ki.27 &#x2018;Nate&#x2019;.

The end result is a book that is useful for all the fully operational types so listed and as such is what makes it such a fine primer on Japanese WWII aircraft. Recommended for those 'getting their feet wet' into the subject.&#x201d; (<i>Modeling Madness</i>)<br><br>"This is one very greatly illustrated book.

Ensconced within this ivory tower, well behind the barbican, but still perhaps uncomfortably close to the garderobe, and well away from the sordid little affairs of the Common Folk, Dr. Love conducts research on the fishes of the Pacific Coat. Possessed of an ego that is the size of the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the color of that young girl&#39;s hair in Rembrandt&#39;s The Night Watch, but curiously smells of new-mown hay, this is not a man to cross.I have enjoyed working with Dr. Milton Love for over 40 years. Through his participation in our education programs thousands of students and educators better understand the role of fishes in our coastal ecosystems. Milton Love has created a fascinating new book: Certainly More Than You Want To Know About The Fishes Of The Pacific Coast. It has thorough descriptions of our Pacific Coast fishes, hilarious stories, and elegant photos. When one thinks of wit and wisdom, the names Benjamin Franklin and Winston Churchill may come to mind. But these intellectual heavyweights with a sense of humor have a contemporary peer, at least in the domain of fishes, and it is Dr. Milton Love. Milton has his own unique twist on just about everything, but in the world of fishes his style of communication and depth of knowledge are without peer. I highly recommend Dr. Love&#39;s new book and suggest it even if you are not a fish hugger. --Jean-Michel Cousteau, Ocean Futures Society</p><h2>Glitterland (Spires)</h2><p><i>The universe is a glitterball I hold in the palm of my hand.<i> Once the golden boy of the English literary scene, now a clinically depressed writer of pulp crime fiction, Ash Winters has given up on love, hope, happiness, and &#x2014; most of all &#x2014; himself.

The journals include Jarman&#39;s love of gardening and flowers while he was growing sicker from AIDS.</p><p>One of England&#x2019;s foremost filmmakers, Derek Jarman (1942&#x2013;1994) wrote and directed several feature films, including <i>Sebastiane</i>, <i>Jubilee</i>, <i>Caravaggio</i>, and <i>Blue</i>, as well as numerous short films and music videos. He was a stage designer, artist, writer, gardener, and an outspoken AIDS and queer rights activist in the United Kingdom and the United States. He wrote several books, among them <i>At Your Own Risk</i>, and <i>Chroma</i>, forthcoming from the University of Minnesota Press.Gay British filmmaker Jarman, who was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1986, follows up his cannon-blast memoir At Your Own Risk (1992) and his memoir of ``my Queerlife,'' Dancing Ledge (p. 505), with his 1989-90 diary of his days fighting his demons while facing the prospect of full-blown AIDS. The diary's overall theme is that of Jarman's illness and what he's doing about it. He begins filming The Garden--a kind of gay Garden of Gethsemane story set in the exquisitely kept (or at least exquisitely described) garden he tends at his coastal cottage at bleak Dungeness. Now and then, the diary looks back frankly at his youth, then at his now-faded love life, or rather sex life, since his friend Howard still lavishes much care and love on him throughout. What there's no getting around here is the immense ``footage'' Jarman gives to his garden, with page after page of silverpoint about his plants and flowers--growths that for most readers will register as totally unfamiliar. But no matter: It's Jarman's tie to his garden that counts--how it invigorates him, though temporary illnesses strike, including bronchitis and blindness. His film War Requiem is a bust, lasting but one week in New York before being pulled. His first week's rushes on The Garden are glaringly bad, ``out-of-focus shots, shots that fall like confetti. 16mm deadly, with no resonance. There is not a shot that is not ugly.'' When he finally begins taking AZT, the results aren't much better. Then the New York Film Festival turns down The Garden. Even so, ``I want to bear witness how happy I am, and will be until the day I die, that I was part of the hated sexual revolution; and that I don't regret a single step or encounter I made in that time....''

Butter and sugar content is slashed and the flavor turned up on everything from ginger snaps to chocolate clouds. From new spins on classic recipes including chocolate-chip cookies and brownies, to delectable 2-point treats for Weight Watchers, to cookies to make with kids, this master conjurer of sweets will bring bliss to every dessert table.</p><p><b>Alice Medrich</b> has won more cookbook-of-the-year awards and best in the dessert and baking category awards than any other author.

Whole-grain flours as well as wheat-free alternatives are becoming more and more prevalent, and people are more often exposed and open to exotic spices and unique flavor combinations. Nibby buckwheat butter cookies, golden kamut shortbread, honey hemp bars, and whole wheat biscotti showcase whole-grain flours, while wheat-free versions of rugelach, toffee bars, butter cookies, and caramel cheesecake bars (just to scratch the surface) aim to please an increasing number of gluten-intolerant dessert lovers. There's a good chunk of dairy-free cookies as well as lower-fat versions (two Weight Watchers points, to be exact). Comfortingly, there are also homey recipes for classic peanut butter cookies, cakey brownies, and rocky road bars. Flavor combos are intriguing, as in the wheat-free grapefruit and basil butter cookies, aniseed and almond shortbread, and nutty cocoa cookie bark with Parmesan and sea salt. The recipes are organized by texture, hence the title, but there's also a section grouping cookies into categories like those containing whole grains, those that keep at least two weeks, ridiculously quick and easy cookies, and cookies to make with kids. This book has redesigned and reframed the often-overlooked cookie and is a boon to the modern, conscious baker.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> &#x201c;Textures, as her title shouts out, drive Medrich&#x2019;s latest, more-than-130-recipe-filled cookie collection. Crispy? Try ginger Florentines and lavender tuiles. Crunchy means biscotti and nut slices. Oatmeal and honey hemp stands for chewy. As for gooey, flaky, and melt-in-your-mouth? Check out brownies in many flavors, rugelach, and the resurrected French macarons. Medrich sets the table by insisting (insofar as the written word can) that readers first review the user&#x2019;s guide, a handy compendium of critical FAQs (e.g., how soft is softened butter?), an index of categories (e.g., whole grain, quick and easy, etc.), and troubleshooting details (e.g., the biggest issue with not-great cookies: too much flour). She carefully prepares bakers for success, including upgrades for most recipes (read variations) and notes about specific types, such as biscotti, tuiles, phyllo dough, and macarons. Last is her tech-support chapter, which wraps up her teachings on ingredients, equipment, and resources. It&#x2019;s time to turn on the oven.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;Booklist</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br><p>"Medrich presents a compendium of exciting and enticing cookie recipes that reflects every aspect of our widening culinary landscape.

George and Willie Muse were two little boys born to a sharecropper family. One day a white man offered them a piece of candy, setting off events that would take them around the world and change their lives forever. Captured into the circus, the Muse brothers performed for royalty at Buckingham Palace and headlined over a dozen sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden. They were global superstars in a pre-broadcast era. But the very root of their success was in the color of their skin and in the outrageous caricatures they were forced to assume: supposed cannibals, sheep-headed freaks, even "Ambassadors from Mars." Back home, their mother never accepted that they were "gone" and spent 28 years trying to get them back. <br> Through hundreds of interviews and decades of research, Beth Macy expertly explores a central and difficult question: Where were the brothers better off? On the world stage as stars or in poverty at home? TRUEVINE is a compelling narrative rich in historical detail and rife with implications to race relations today.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2016:</strong> At the center of Beth Macy&#x2019;s exhaustively researched and fascinating <em>Truevine</em> are two brothers, either abducted or bartered to a circus where the African American albinos were forced to present themselves as &#x201c;Ambassadors from Mars,&#x201d; or &#x201c;White Ecuadorian Cannibals,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Sheep-Headed Men&#x201d; (no matter the iteration, they could play mandolin and guitar, too!). George and Willie Muse traveled the world, even performing for the Queen of England, while their mother remained in the Jim Crow South, not knowing where and how they were. She never gave up hope, however, and nearly three decades later they were reunited, setting off a protracted legal battle, the result of which ensured that her sons would be paid their due. Now think about that for a second. It&#x2019;s almost easier to believe that her children were, in fact, from Mars than to accept that a black woman was able to utilize and benefit from a legal system during a time when lynchings were still horrifyingly common. And yet that&#x2019;s how determined and fearless she was. Macy deftly, and with palpable reverence, captures the extraordinary bond between the three of them&#x2014;a bond unscrupulous scouting agents, greedy circus owners, a perfidious father, and 28 years of separation couldn&#x2019;t break. But this isn&#x2019;t a story with a bow tacked on at the end. There is an uncomfortable thread that runs throughout: For all mother Muse did to bring her boys home, did the circus provide a better one? A place where the &#x201c;freaks&#x201d; found community, purpose--where their otherness was exploited, but also celebrated? (Even rewarded?) And there are other complex racial questions <em>Truevine</em> raises, questions we are still grappling with today. It&#x2019;s a multi-layered story that will captivate, haunt, and challenge you. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em>Beth Macy writes about outsiders and underdogs, and she is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Factory Man</i>.

In simple but powerful prose, the deeply moving Drama of the Gifted Child showed how parents unconsciously form and deform the emotional lives of their children. Alice Miller&#39;s stories about the roots of suffering in childhood resonated with readers, and her book soon became a backlist best seller.In The Truth Will Set You Free Miller returns to the intensely personal tone and themes of her best-loved work. Only by embracing the truth of our past histories can any of us hope to be free of pain in the present, she argues. Miller uses vivid true stories to reveal the perils of early-childhood mistreatment and the dangers of mindless obedience to parental will. Drawing on the latest research on brain development, she shows how spanking and humiliation produce dangerous levels of denial, which leads in turn to emotional blindness and to mental barriers that cut off awareness and the ability to learn new ways of acting. If this cycle repeats itself, the grown child will perpetrate the same abuse on later generations--a message vitally important, especially given the increasing popularity of programs like Tough Love and of &#34;child disciplinarians&#34; like James Dobson. The Truth Will Set You Free will provoke and inform all readers who want to know Alice Miller&#39;s latest thinking on this important subject.</p><p><b>Alice Miller</b> has achieved worldwide recognition for her work on the causes and effects of childhood traumas. Her books include <i>The Drama of the Gifted Child</i>, <i>Banished Knowledge</i>, <i>Breaking Down the Wall of Silence</i>, <i>Thou Shalt Not Be Aware</i>, and <i>For Your Own Good</i>. She lives in Switzerland.With the premise that abuse begets abuse, the famed Swiss psychoanalyst mounts an eloquent argument against all forms of cruelty to children, especially corporal punishment. Believing that "[o]ur bodies retain a complete memory of the humiliations we suffered, driving us to inflict unconsciously on the next generation what we endured in childhood," she argues that childhood trauma is also manifest in many physical ailments, urging doctors to take "childhood reality" into account during treatment. However, frequent references to her other books, notably the bestselling The Drama of the Gifted Child and For Your Own Good give this slim book an air of preaching to the converted. Miller reiterates her distrust of "sadism sanctioned by religions" from Islam to U.S. Christian schools, and of behaviors that range from genital mutilation and circumcision to corporal punishment. She reserves particular concern for the Catholic Church's failure to outlaw beatings in European schools. Among her most intriguing finding is that children who survive brutality without repeating it generally have enjoyed the affection of a "Helping Witness" in their lives. Adults, too, can free themselves through rigorous analysis that acknowledges early trauma and confronts one's defense mechanisms and behavior patterns. Some forms of psychotherapy may be useful, Miller believes, but she discounts the value of "relaxation training or meditation." Even "power of love" alone can be overestimated, she says. (Sept.)Forecast: Given Miller's stature, this book will be visible, though the publicity may drive readers to her more seminal works.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>When the Enemy Strikes Workbook: The Keys to Winning Your Spiritual Battles</h2><p><p>Fear.

Founded in New York City in 1816, ABS is dedicated to the purpose of presenting the Bible in compelling ways, enabling readers to experience life in its fullness through faith in Jesus Christ. ABS has a number of &#34;firsts&#34; in its record books: the first Bibles in hotels, the first pocket Bibles for soldiers (during the Civil war), and the first Bibles provided for the U.S. Military in 1817. The Society extends its outreach internationally through the United Bible Societies (UBS), a fellowship of 126 international Bible societies, and was instrumental in founding this global fellowship in the interest of greater ministry impact and efficiency. In 1999 alone, more than 63 million copies of the Society&#39;s publications were distributed throughout the United States and the world. The CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH VERSION was published by the American Bible Society in response to an urgent need for a translation that would reach those many millions who are not reading the Bible. The goal was a Bible that is a serious translation-not a paraphrase-that combines historical and scholarly accuracy with contemporary language that everyone can understand. The result is a Bible that resonates with all people, wherever they may be in their spiritual journey. At last, a Bible that is easy to read, yet allows for a deeper connection to the very God who created us.

Lush and immersive, and devastating in its power, <i>The Parisian</i> is a tour de force from a dazzling new voice in fiction.</p><p>ISABELLA HAMMAD was born in London. She won the 2018 Plimpton Prize for Fiction for her story &#x201c;Mr. Can&#x2019;aan&#x201d; and a 2019 O. Henry Prize. <i>The Parisian</i> is her first novel.There was one other Arab onboard the ship to Marseille. His name was Faruq al-Azma, and the day after leaving port in Alexandria he approached Midhat at breakfast, with a plate of toast in one hand and a string of amber prayer beads in the other. He sat, tugged at the cuffs of his shirt, and started to describe without any introduction how he was returning from Damascus to resume his teaching post in the language department of the Sorbonne. He had left Paris at the outbreak of war but after the Miracle of the Marne was deter-mined to return. He had grey eyes and a slightly rectangular head.<br>&#x201c;Al-Baris.&#x201d; He sighed. &#x201c;It is where my life is.&#x201d;<br>To young Midhat Kamal, this statement was highly suggestive. In his mind a gallery of lamps directly illuminated a dance hall full of women. He looked closely at Faruq&#x2019;s clothes.

In these essays, Williams, a renowned cultural critic, demonstrates how these key words take on new meanings and how these changes reflect the political bent and values of our past and current society. He chose words both essential and intangible--words like <em>nature, underprivileged, industry, liberal, violence</em>, to name a few--and, by tracing their etymology and evolution, grounds them in a wider political and cultural framework. The result is an illuminating account of the central vocabulary of ideological debate in English in the modern period. <br><br>This edition features a new original foreword by Colin MacCabe, Distinguished Professor of English and Literature, University of Pittsburgh, that reflects on the significance of Williams' life and work. <em>Keywords</em> remains as relevant today as it was over thirty years ago, offering a provocative study of our language and an insightful look at the society in which we live.<br></p><p><br><strong>Raymond Williams</strong> (1921 - 1988) was a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge University. <br><br><strong>Colin MacCabe</strong> is Distinguished Professor of English and Literature, University of Pittsburgh, and author of numerous books on literature and theory of language.<br></p><h2>A Line in the Sand</h2><p>Through a stellar cast of politicians, diplomats, spies and soldiers - including T.E.

Part 1 tells the story of how these bands were used in the rural communities of 18th and 19th century Norway, as stocking bands, swaddling bands, sending bands, and more. Part 2 looks closely at twenty bands brought to America by Norwegian immigrants, and what they tell us about traditional patterns, colors, and materials. Part 3 has clear and concise instructions for weaving pick-up on simple, traditional band heddles, and these instructions can also be adapted to other kinds of looms. Meticulously researched, easy-to-read, and profusely illustrated, this book is destined to become a classic in the field.

A former game designer and editor, he lives in southern Wisconsin with his wife, Andria.One<br><br>Tenel Ka sensed the hole in the Force the instant she entered the bedchamber. It was lurking in the black depths of the corner farthest from the entrance, a void so subtle she recognized it only by the surrounding stillness. She moved quickly through the doorway, her spine tingling with a ripple of danger sense so delicate it made her blood race.<br><br>Before her lady-in-waiting could enter the room behind her, she looked back over her shoulder and called, &#x201c;That will be all, Lady Aros. Ask DeDeToo to lock down the nursery.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lock it down, Majesty?&#x201d; Aros stopped at the threshold, a slender silhouette still holding the evening gown Tenel Ka had just removed. &#x201c;Is there something I need to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a precaution,&#x201d; Tenel Ka interrupted. Her robe was still hanging inside her refresher suite, so she was standing in her underclothes. &#x201c;I know our embassy should be secure, but this is Coruscant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course . . .&#x201d; Aros dipped her chin. &#x201c;The terrorists. This rach warren of a planet is absolutely teeming with them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not be too disparaging, shall we?&#x201d; Tenel Ka chided. She casually reached down and unfastened the thigh holster where she carried her lightsaber. &#x201c;We did have to call on Colonel Solo to dispose of a few raches of our own recently.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean anything negative about the colonel,&#x201d; Aros said, practically cooing the reference to Jacen. After his recent heroics defending Tenel Ka against the traitors trying to usurp her throne, he had become something of a sex symbol to half the women in the Hapes Consortium . . . Tenel Ka included. &#x201c;Quite the opposite. If not for Colonel Solo, I&#x2019;m sure Coruscant would have sunk into anarchy by now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No doubt,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said, casually shifting her grasp on the holster so that she held her lightsaber by its hilt. &#x201c;Now if you&#x2019;ll excuse me, I believe I can turn down my own sheets tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>Aros acknowledged the order with a bow and withdrew into the anteroom. Tenel Ka used her elbow to depress a tap pad on the wall. Half a dozen wall sconces glimmered to life, revealing a chamber as ridiculously opulent as the rest of the embassy&#x2019;s Royal Wing. There were three separate seating areas, a life-sized HoloNet transceiver, and a huge hamogoni wood desk stocked with stacks of flimsiplast bearing the Hapan Royal Crest. On the far side of the chamber, a dreamsilk canopy shimmered above a float-rest bed large enough to sleep Tenel Ka and her ten closest friends.<br><br>Despite the two sconces flanking it, the room&#x2019;s farthest corner&#x2014;the one near her refresher suite&#x2014;remained ominously dark. Tenel Ka could not sense any sort of optical field keeping it that way, but then again, the only thing she could sense was . . . well, nothing. She reached out with the Force to make certain Aros was not eavesdropping from the other side of the door, then ignited her lightsaber and took a few steps toward the corner.<br><br>&#x201c;You would be wise to show yourself,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said. &#x201c;I have no patience for voyeurs . . . as you should well know by now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a slow learner.&#x201d; The darkness melted away, revealing a tall, shadow-eyed figure with a melancholy echo of his father&#x2019;s famous lopsided grin. He was dressed in black GAG utilities and smelled faintly of hyperdrive fuel, as though he had come to her straight from a space hangar. &#x201c;And I don&#x2019;t usually get caught. My camouflage powers must be slipping.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Jacen. I am just growing better at sensing your presence.&#x201d; Tenel Ka deactivated her lightsaber and tossed it on the bed, then smiled warmly and opened her arms to him. &#x201c;I was hoping you would find time to call.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen cocked his brow, then let his gaze slide down her body. &#x201c;So I see.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Tenel Ka asked. &#x201c;Are you just going to stand there gawking? Or are you going to do something about it?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen chuckled, then stepped out of the corner and crossed to her. His Force presence remained undetectable&#x2014;he was so accustomed to concealing himself that he did so even around Tenel Ka&#x2014;but she could tell by the shine in his eyes how happy he was to see her. She slipped a hand behind his neck and drew his mouth to hers.<br><br>Jacen obliged, but his kiss was warm rather than hot, and she could tell that tonight his heart was not entirely hers. She stepped back, embarrassed to realize how insensitive she was being.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me if I seem too joyful,&#x201d; she said, able to perceive now the sadness that tinged his hard eyes, the grief that tainted his clenched jaw. &#x201c;Tomorrow is Mara&#x2019;s funeral. Of course you have other things on your mind.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen&#x2019;s snort was so gentle that Tenel Ka almost did not hear it.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; He took her hand, but the softness had vanished from his face, leaving in its place only the stoic, unreadable mask that he had worn since his escape from the Yuuzhan Vong. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t thinking about Mara.&#x201d;<br><br>Tenel Ka eyed him doubtfully.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, not exclusively,&#x201d; Jacen admitted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy to see you, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, but I&#x2019;m not offended,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said. &#x201c;Our thoughts should be on your aunt tonight. Have you found her killer yet?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen&#x2019;s face flickered with emotion&#x2014;whether it was anger or resentment was impossible to say&#x2014;and something like guilt flashed through the Force so quickly that Tenel Ka was still trying to identify it when Jacen closed down again.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re still working on that.&#x201d; Jacen&#x2019;s tone was defensive, and his gaze slid away in . . . could that be shame? &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have many leads, and I don&#x2019;t like the direction they&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is very cryptic,&#x201d; Tenel Ka observed. &#x201c;Can you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Jacen said, shaking his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s still early in the investigation, and I don&#x2019;t want to taint anyone&#x2019;s reputation.&#x201d;<br><br>Tenel Ka frowned at the implication. &#x201c;You think it was someone inside the GA?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen flashed a mock scowl. &#x201c;Did I say that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Tenel Ka looped her hand through the elbow of his black utilities and changed the subject. &#x201c;But it was thoughtless of me to ask about the investigation, especially with the funeral tomorrow. I hope you&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t apologize.&#x201d; Jacen detached himself and moved to the nearest couch, then sat on the arm. &#x201c;The truth is, I haven&#x2019;t been doing very much to find her killer. The Alliance has higher priorities at the moment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The war?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re receiving the military&#x2019;s briefing holos.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; In fact, the holos had been arriving twice a day for nearly a week now, along with urgent requests for Hapan reinforcements, which Tenel Ka could not provide. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me that Admiral Niathal has prevailed on you to talk me out of my last fleet?&#x201d;<br><br>Instead of answering, Jacen slipped over the couch arm onto a cushion, then sat staring into the flame tube that was the focal point of the seating area.<br><br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said, astonished that Jacen would agree to even attempt such a thing. He knew as well as she did that granting the Alliance request would place both their daughter and her throne in profound danger. &#x201c;There is nothing to send, Jacen. As it is, the Home Fleet is barely enough to secure the Consortium from my own nobles.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You still need to hear this.&#x201d; Jacen continued to stare into the swirling tongues of blue inside the flame tube. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re aware that Corellia and Bothawui are moving against Kuat, right?&#x201d;<br><br>Tenel Ka nodded. &#x201c;While the Hutts and Commenor make preparations to attack Balmorra.&#x201d; She retrieved her dressing gown from inside the refresher, then added, &#x201c;I do watch those holos they keep sending me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;just making sure,&#x201d; Jacen said. &#x201c;But what the briefings don&#x2019;t say&#x2014;what they can&#x2019;t say&#x2014;is that after the battle at Balmorra, the Confederation is going to mass its fleets at Kuat. Whoever wins there wins the war.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Military planners always think the next big space battle will end the war.&#x201d; Tenel Ka slipped the dressing gown over her shoulders and returned to the seating area. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re usually wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This doesn&#x2019;t come from the planners,&#x201d; Jacen said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen it . . . in the Force.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Tenel Ka dropped into a chair adjacent to Jacen&#x2019;s, stunned by the implications of what she had just heard. If Jacen&#x2019;s Force-vision was accurate&#x2014;and she knew enough about his Force powers to think it would be&#x2014;the Confederation would soon have a massive force in position to threaten Coruscant herself. &#x201c;I see why you are worried.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Worried might be an understatement,&#x201d; Jacen replied. &#x201c;So would terrified. The Alliance just doesn&#x2019;t have the strength to stop them yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yet?&#x201d; Tenel Ka asked. &#x201c;Are you telling me that Thrackan Sal-Solo wasn&#x2019;t the only one building secret fleets?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen shook his head. &#x201c;Sorry. I&#x2019;m talking about the Wookiees. Kashyyyk is certain to assign their assault fleet to our command, and that will tip the balance back in the Alliance&#x2019;s favor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt the Confederation is going to wait that long,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said, almost bitterly. Alliance holochannels were filled with impatient speculation about the endless debate on Kashyyyk, with the commentary ranging from simple impatience to accusations of cowardice. &#x201c;Are you telling me the public reports are misdirection?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a bad idea, but no,&#x201d; Jacen said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you that our agents assure us it&#x2019;s a matter of when, not if.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In this instance, when is if,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said. &#x201c;Wookiees are very stubborn. By the time they finish their deliberations, the Confederation will be storming Coruscant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d; Jacen tore his eyes from the flame tube, then met Tenel Ka&#x2019;s gaze. For once, she could sense his emotions through the Force, could feel how frightened and worried he truly was. &#x201c;But I just don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said, finally starting to realize what Jacen was trying to tell her. &#x201c;And you didn&#x2019;t come to ask for the Home Fleet?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen shook his head. &#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was afraid of that.&#x201d; Tenel Ka sank back in her chair, calling on the Force to keep her heart rate under control, her thoughts focused. &#x201c;So you only came to warn me that the Galactic Alliance is about to collapse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s not the only reason.&#x201d; Jacen grinned and cocked an eyebrow.<br><br>Tenel Ka groaned. &#x201c;This is no time for jokes, Jacen. Your timing is worse than when we were teenagers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, then I could use some advice instead,&#x201d; Jacen said, accepting the rebuff as gracefully as he had when they were younger. &#x201c;Have any?&#x201d;<br><br>Tenel Ka&#x2019;s answer was immediate. &#x201c;The Jedi could do something. Perhaps they could launch a StealthX raid, or perhaps Master Skywalker could speak to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I asked for advice, not wishful thinking.&#x201d; Jacen&#x2019;s voice was suddenly sharp. &#x201c;The Jedi won&#x2019;t lift a finger to help us. They&#x2019;re practically traitors themselves.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jacen, that&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; Tenel Ka said, refusing to be intimidated. &#x201c;The Jedi have supported the Galactic Alliance since its inception, and Master Skywalker is on the same side you are. If the Alliance is to be saved, you two must put aside your differences and work together.&#x201d;<br><br>A flash of fear flickered through Jacen&#x2019;s eyes, then he looked away, reminding Tenel Ka of some petulant courtier refusing to acknowledge a rebuke.<br><br>&#x201c;And if we can&#x2019;t?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you stop the enemy&#x2019;s advance without the Jedi?&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen shook his head. &#x201c;Not at the moment&#x2014;and maybe not with them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then what choice is there?&#x201d; Tenel Ka made the question a command. &#x201c;The Jedi Council is unhappy about your coup, but the Masters will not stand idle while the Alliance falls&#x2014;especially not if you grant concessions.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacen fell silent a moment, then turned to face Tenel Ka. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s more complicated than that. Luke hasn&#x2019;t been himself since Mara died.&#x201d; His dark brows arched in concern. &#x201c;He barely talks to anyone, and he&#x2019;s drawn in on himself so far he&#x2019;s practically cut off from the Force.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Surely you don&#x2019;t expect him to remain unaffected by his wife&#x2019;s death?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than grief,&#x201d; Jacen said. &#x201c;You heard about Lumiya?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard that he truly killed her this time.&#x201d; Tenel Ka&#x2019;s answer was cautious, for the &#x2019;Net had been full of reports linking Lumiya&#x2019;s death to Mara&#x2019;s&#x2014;until the Jedi Council had issued a terse statement asserting that Lumiya&#x2019;s demise involved other matters. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to believe the timing was purely coincidental.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Jacen said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it was a vengeance killing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A vengeance killing?&#x201d; Tenel Ka shook her head in disbelief. &#x201c;Even if Master Skywalker would do such a thing, it doesn&#x2019;t make sense. The Jedi Council itself said that Lumiya had nothing to do with Mara&#x2019;s death.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Luke didn&#x2019;t discover that until after he killed Lumiya&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s when he began to draw in on himself.&#x201d; Jacen leaned forward, propping his elbows on his knees and staring at the polished larmalstone between his boots. &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s having a crisis of confidence, Tenel Ka. I think he&#x2019;s stopped trusting himself . . . and the Force.&#x201d;<br><br>Tenel Ka frowned. She had the feeling that Jacen was forcing his emotions; that he was merely trying to be concerned while secretly relishing his uncle&#x2019;s mistake. And who could blame him? Master Skywalker had accused Jacen of some fairly terrible things lately&#x2014;such as collaborating with a Sith and staging an illegal coup&#x2014;so it would only be natural to gloat when his denouncer did something even worse.<br><br>After a moment, she said, &#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;re right, Jacen. That would explain why Master Sebatyne turned me away when I tried to call on your uncle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Luke wouldn&#x2019;t see you?&#x201d; Jacen was incredulous. &#x201c;Then matters are worse than I thought. He can&#x2019;t be up to his duties.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is more than understandable.&#x201d; While it saddened Tenel Ka to think of Master Skywalker&#x2019;s pain&#x2014;and Ben&#x2019;s&#x2014;she shared Jacen&#x2019;s alarm. Now was a disastrous time for the Alliance to be without its Jedi. &#x201c;But Master Skywalker is not the only member of the Jedi Council.

At stake is not just sales, but cultural relevancy and the hearts of millions of fans.<br><br>To many partisans, Marvel is now on top. But for much of the early 20th century, it was DC that was the undisputed leader, having launched the American superhero genre with the 1938 publication of Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel's Superman strip. DC's titles sold millions of copies every year, and its iconic characters were familiar to nearly everyone in America. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman--DC had them all.<br><br>And then in 1961, an upstart company came out of nowhere to smack mighty DC in the chops. With the publication of Fantastic Four #1, Marvel changed the way superheroes stories were done. Writer-editor Stan Lee, artists Jack Kirby, and the talented Marvel bullpen subsequently unleashed a string of dazzling new creations, including the Avengers, Hulk, Spider-Man, the X-Men, and Iron Man.<br><br>Marvel's rise forever split fandom into two opposing tribes. Suddenly the most telling question you could ask a superhero lover became "Marvel or DC?"<br><br><i>Slugfest</i>, the first book to chronicle the history of this epic rivalry into a single, in-depth narrative, is the story of the greatest corporate rivalry never told. Complete with interviews with the major names in the industry, <i>Slugfest</i> reveals the arsenal of schemes the two companies have employed in their attempts to outmaneuver the competition, whether it be stealing ideas, poaching employees, planting spies, or launching price wars. The feud has never completely disappeared, and it simmers on a low boil to this day. With DC and Marvel characters becoming global icons worth billions, if anything, the stakes are higher now than ever before.<br><b></b></p><p><b>Reed Tucker</b> is a freelance journalist and writer and has lived in New York since 1999.

Philip Pullman begins his Sally Lockhart trilogy with a bang in <i>The Ruby in the Smoke</i>--a fast-paced, finely crafted thriller set in a rogue- and scalawag-ridden Victorian London. His 16-year-old heroine has no time for the usual trials of adolescence: her father has been murdered, and she needs to find out how and why. But everywhere she turns, she encounters new scoundrels and secrets. Why do the mere words "seven blessings" cause one man to keel over and die at their utterance? Who has possession of the rare, stolen ruby? And what does the opium trade have to do with it?<p> As our determined and intelligent sleuth sets her mind to unraveling these dark mysteries, she learns how embroiled she is in the whole affair. As riveting and witty as the sensational "penny dreadfuls" of Victorian England (but thousands of times better written), Pullman's trilogy (including <i>The Shadow in the North</i> and <i>The Tiger in the Well</i>) will have readers on the edges of their seats. <i>Ruby</i> is an ALA Best Book for Young Adults.

Traditional vocal training methods, says Dimon, cannot be effective without restoring the functioning of the musculature that supports the voice. <br><br>Enhanced with over 50 detailed full-color illustrations, the book discusses the fallacy of traditional breathing exercises and&nbsp;explains that the key to efficient breathing lies in the expansive support of the trunk and rib cage. Investigating the elements needed to produce a strong supported tone, Dimon describes the importance of voice &#x201c;placement,&#x201d; or directing the sound to&nbsp;a part of the body in order to produce a fully rounded, resonant tone. He identifies harmful patterns of speech and singing, and offers helpful methods for reestablishing the natural function of the vocal mechanism. Individual chapters cover elements of the whispered &#x201c;ah,&#x201d; producing a pure sung tone, vocal registers, the suspensory muscles of the larynx, and more.</p><p>The director of the Dimon Institute in New York City, Theodore Dimon, EdD, teaches and lectures internationally.

Baldaev's father, a respected ethnographer, taught him techniques to record the tattoos of criminals in St. Petersburg's notorious Kresty prison, where Danzig worked as a guard. He was reported to the K.G.B. who unexpectedly offered support for his work, allowing him the opportunity to travel across the former U.S.S.R. Witnessing scenes of everyday life in the Gulag, he chronicled this previously closed world from both sides of the wire. With every vignette, Baldaev brings the characters he depicts to vivid life: from the lowest "zek" (inmate) to the most violent tattooed "vor" (thief), all the practices and inhabitants of the Gulag system are depicted here in incredible and often shocking detail. In documenting the attitude of the authorities to those imprisoned, and the transformation of these citizens into survivors or victims of the Gulag system, this graphic novel vividly depicts methods of torture and mass murder undertaken by the administration, as well as the atrocities committed by criminals upon their fellow inmates.<br><br><b>Danzig Baldaev</b> was born in 1925 in Ulan-Ude, Buryatiya, Russia. In 1948, after serving in the army in World War II, he was ordered by the N.K.V.D. to work as a warden in the infamous Leningrad prison, Kresty, where he started drawing the tattoos of criminals. His collection of drawings, which he made in different reformatory settlements for criminals all over the former U.S.S.R. over a period of more than 50 years, have been published by Fuel in three volumes, in the bestselling <i>Russian Criminal Tattoo Encyclopaedia</i> series.</p><p>In the Soviet Union, desk drawers became sarcophagi; entombed within them were the creative endeavours of the most talented and perceptive Soviet citizens. Yet it is best not to idealise such hiding spaces as reserves of dormant illumination; indeed, there may have been no limit to the depths of darkness possible within them.<br>Consider the case of Danzig Baldaev. Born in 1925 in Ulan-Ude, in east-central Russia, Baldaev was the son of an ethnographer who was arrested as an "enemy of the people". He grew up in an orphanage for the children of "enemies" and following his service in the second world war was "forced", as he described it, by the NKVD (a forerunner of the KGB) to work as a warder at Kresty prison in Leningrad, now St Petersburg. His employment in the Soviet penal system took him all over the USSR, but in private, he poured the psychological detritus of his profession into a terrifying work of sadistic pornography, which he dedicated, in 1988, to Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

So, what will our world be like in twenty years? Come take a look as futurists Amy Zuckerman and James Daly examine what a kid&#x2019;s daily life might be like in the year 2030. Inspired and informed by trends and scientifi c and technological research, <i>2030</i> is not only a peek at some cool future gadgets (talking dog collars, cars that drive themselves), but also a thoughtful examination of how our lives might be impacted as we adjust to environmental change.</p><p>Amy Zuckerman is an award-winning business writer who specializes in technology and trends. She lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.<p> James Daly is the publisher of <i>Edutopia</i> magazine and founder of <i>Business 2.0<i></i>.

The breezy narrative follows one boy through a typical day, highlighting many interesting aspects of his world. Fanciful cartoon drawings show a lively and appealing world full of new and intriguing activities that correspond neatly to modern equivalents. Schools are now made from plasticized blocks that snap together, for example, while recess features virtual batting practice and a "smart trampoline." Recreational activities include magnetized hovering skateboards and a virtual-reality "Fanta-trek Center." Some social changes are briefly noted, such as new career paths and the increase of marriages between different ethnicities. Interaction with the natural world is not mentioned, although many of the new technologies have eco-friendly components and the food is all meatless and delicious. Illustrated sidebars provide a bit of additional information or background, but the emphasis here is more on what new technologies will do, rather than how they will work. The one exception to the fun comes in an inset paragraph about overpopulation and starvation in Africa, a jarring bit of realism in this otherwise worry-free existence. The day ends with a neat twist as the boy reaches for his favorite type of entertainment, which the final page turn reveals as "reading a book."&#x2014;<i>Steven Engelfried, Multnomah County Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's as if someone is executing a preconceived plan to make all the random pieces of my life fit together. What is it? Karma? Kismet? Synchronicity? I don't know, but it happens to me a lot, and more often than not it works out well. I just seem to meet the right teachers at the right time.</p><p>I've been blessed (maybe that's the word) with the opportunity to work with some of the world's preeminent thinkers in business leadership--like Tom Peters and Jim Kouzes, to name a couple. And in recent years, under extremely odd and seemingly fortuitous circumstances, I've learned directly from some of the masters of what I've come to know as Extreme Leadership--like William Maritime and Agnes Golden and Ted Garrison, names that'll be familiar to readers of my previous books. All of them, in their own ways, taught me that real leadership is not about calling yourself "leader"; rather, it's about taking up the cause to change some piece of the world for the better. Real leadership, in other words, is an extreme act rooted in love and motivated by a desire to create a better world--whether it's the world of your company, team, neighborhood, or family. Simply put, real leadership is Extreme Leadership.</p><p>I've done a pretty good job of conveying the Extreme Leadership lessons I've learned along the way, and I think that's why I've made a bit of a name for myself in certain circles. Some have even used the words Steve Farber and leadership guru in the same sentence, which, although gratifying to my ego, makes me squirm like I have a load of wet worms in my socks.</p><p>Right teachers. Right time. Odd circumstances.</p><p>I was thinking I should print that on my business card, because it seemed to happen over and over again.</p><p>I was back in my apartment on the bay side of the Mission Beach area of San Diego. The ocean and its frenetic boardwalk were a couple of blocks to the west, but calm, tranquil Mission Bay lay just a few short yards to the east of my building, affording a view through my living room window worthy of a tourist's postcard.</p><p>I had returned from Carlsbad a couple of hours earlier, cleared my agenda by taking care of a few time-bound tasks, and was now--finally!--ready to spend some quality time getting intimate with my new companion.</p><p>I gingerly placed the tattered, half-a-century-old, mottled brown guitar case on the dining room table. I flipped open the latches, lifted the top, and let my gaze linger over the sunburst-colored curves of my new six-string babe.</p><p>Sitting on a bar stool with the guitar propped in my lap, I twisted the tuning knobs until the sound was just right, and fired off a couple of quick blues licks in the key of E. I'd plug it in later; for now I was enjoying the smooth feel of the Brazilian rosewood fingerboard and the muted, rich sound resonating off its unamplified, maple body. I was just about to settle in for a couple of hours of serious playing (which sounds like an oxymoron--but it's not) when something in the case caught my eye. I set the guitar in a stand and got up to take a closer look.</p><p>The pink, plush lining on the inside bottom of the case was pulled slightly back at the seam. A small, yellowed piece of paper stuck out from under the fabric. I pinched the corner and pulled on it gently. It slid easily from under the velvet and revealed itself to be a handwritten note.</p><p>I felt a voyeuristic jolt similar to what an archaeologist must feel when finding a relic offering a glimpse into another's life, in another time.</p><p>"Dear Jessica," the note began. "This guitar is my gift to you. It was made in 1959, thirty-one years before I taught you your first lesson. What a player you've become in just five short years. Now that you're old enough to vote and on your way to school and the distractions of adult life, you'll need this guitar to remind you of your wonderful musical gift. May it help you to become a better player than I could ever hope to be. I have no doubt you will.</p><p>"You have brought this old teacher of yours more joy than you could possibly know. I want you to know that I'm very, very proud of you.</p><p>"Your friend and teacher, GZ."</p><p>"You've been around, haven't you?" I said to the guitar in the stand.</p><p>I read the note one more time and tried to imagine the teacher, the student, and the strong bond that had obviously existed between them. It was an unusual thing, that kind of connection. I'd been lucky enough to experience that student-teacher bond in my professional life, and I knew how rare and priceless a thing it could be, so, naturally, I found myself wondering where these people were today and what, if anything, had happened with Jessica's life as a guitarist--or if she even continued playing at all.</p><p>The way I figured it, this note was written somewhere around 1995, and if Jessica had just been entering college, that would put her in her early thirties today.</p><p>Had GZ's pride been well placed? Had Jessica grown into the kind of adult he'd hoped she would? And why, if their relationship had been as special as the teacher's note implied, had Jessica gone on to sell this wonderful and sentimental gift? You'd think if she'd returned even a little of her teacher's affection, she'd at least have kept the note.</p><p>Given my sudden and intense curiosity about all this, I found myself faced with two possible paths: I could either make up imaginary answers to these questions, or I could snoop around to see if I couldn't uncover the real story of Jessica and GZ.</p><p>And I bet you can guess which road I traveled by.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>Obviously, the name, Jessica, and the initials, GZ, weren't a whole lot to go on, so I did the only thing I could think of at the moment. Vintage guitars get bought, sold, and traded more often than the uninitiated might think. So it was unlikely, to say the least, that Jessica had just walked into the guitar shop and sold it to the proprietor. Nevertheless, I had to give it a shot. I called, asked for the owner of the store, and asked him if he could tell me the name of the guitar's previous owner.</p><p>"Sorry," he said. "I really can't help you with that."</p><p>"I understand," I said, disappointed. "You have to protect the confidentiality of your customers."</p><p>He laughed. "Yeah, I guess I do, but that's not what I mean. I bought it at a local guitar show from another dealer. There's no telling how many times that guitar's changed hands. As for tracking down who owned it last? Well, all I could tell you is good luck with that."</p><p>I thanked him and was just about to hang up when he asked me to hold on for a second.</p><p>"I don't know if this'll help you," he said. "But there was a guy in here the other day asking about that same guitar. Said he had a friend that used to have one just like it, and that he may be interested. But he hasn't come back yet."</p><p>My heart did a little zippity-zip. I wondered if that ever happened to the Law and Order guys when they got a lead. "You wouldn't happen to know his name, would you?"</p><p>"Dude," he said. "What kind of a salesperson do you think I am? Of course I took his name. Hold on . . ."</p><p>He left me hanging for a minute while I listened to him rustle through some papers.</p><p>"Here it is: Charles Roland."</p><p>"That's great," I said, and spelled the name back to him.</p><p>"And I bet you want his number, too, don't you?"</p><p>"I love you," I said.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I left a message on Charles Roland's voice mail. I told him briefly about the guitar and the note, and requested that if, by chance, he might know anything about any of this, that he please give me a call or drop me an e-mail. I left all my contact info and, not expecting any kind of response, figured that would be the end of the line for my fleeting life as a private investigator.</p><p>So, with my fantasy tucked neatly away with my guitar and the note folded in my shirt pocket, I decided to take a scenic drive up the coast and enjoy the impending sunset. I got in my car, headed up through La Jolla, and soon found myself entering the posh and charming little town of Del Mar. It had been a while since I'd stopped to fully take in the spectacle of the sun disappearing over the western horizon, so I decided to treat myself to a late-afternoon appetizer at Il Fornaio and watch Mother Nature's show from atop the Del Mar Plaza.</p><p>I parked the car in the lot and took the elevator to the open courtyard on the top floor, which offered a spectacular panoramic view of the blue water shining brilliantly in the light of the descending sun. I stepped up to the open-air bar at the restaurant, ordered calamari and a Diet Coke with lemon, and found an open table pushed up against the glass wind barrier.</p><p>I took a quick moment to scan the e-mail on my iPhone and saw that I had a recent message. My chest thumped when I read the subject line: "A response from Charles Roland." Polite and formal in his tone, Mr. Roland wrote that he was "surprised and delighted" to hear about that note and that, yes, he did know the people involved and would love to meet me so he could see it firsthand.</p><p>So, there it was. Easy as pie, I thought.</p><p>After a couple of terse, back-and-forth e-mails, we agreed to meet the next morning at a coffee shop in Pacific Beach, just a mile or so up Mission Boulevard from where I lived.</p><p>So, the following morning found me at Peet's Coffee, sitting at an outside table, and sipping a double shot mocha while I watched the early morning traffic. The ocean was just a block away and the salt smell was, thankfully, much stronger than that of the exhaust fumes. The marine layer fogged out the sunshine, and as the caffeine lifted the fog from my brain, I considered the meeting that was just about to take place. I was surprised at how excited I was to hear about Jessica and GZ. You'd almost think I didn't have any friends of my own.</p><p>"Good morning, Mr. Farber."</p><p>I looked up at, I assumed, Charles Roland.</p><p>"And you would be Charles Roland?" I said, rising politely from my chair.</p><p>"That I would," he said as we clasped hands.</p><p>Charles's appearance was unusual in that there wasn't anything unusual about his appearance. He was the kind of guy who'd easily blend in with the fortysomething suit-and-tie kind of crowd--not exactly the profile of the typical San Diego beach collection, but I figured that he was on his way to the office and was dressed for that world, not this.</p><p>He wore his dark brown hair in a conservative cut that gave the impression that he visited his barber every couple of weeks. His white shirt was starched and crisp and pressed in a way that, no matter what I did or had done to them, my shirts would never conform to. He wore a simple gold band on the ring finger of his left hand. With his gray suit and dark, patterned tie, I assumed Charles Roland must be some kind of a corporate stiff. An office drone in worsted wool.</p><p>Let me just say in my own defense that I am not a judgmental person by nature. I am, I would like to think, one of the more accepting people you'll ever meet, and I say that with utmost humility. In other words, my rush to judgment here was entirely out of character. Looking back on it now, I missed some of the more subtle signs of Charles Roland's demeanor, which, in retrospect, should have been as obvious as a tuba.</p><p>I offered to get him a coffee and he declined.</p><p>"So, Mr. Roland," I started in cautiously, "this is such a strange scenario. Kind of romantic in a way, isn't it?"</p><p>"I suppose so," he said, almost mechanically. "And please call me Charles. May I see the note?"</p><p>I handed it to him and watched him read. Except for a very slight rising of the eyebrows, his face was emotionless.</p><p>He handed the note back to me, saying nothing.</p><p>"So . . ." I just couldn't read this guy. "Jessica and GZ," I said into the awkward silence. "What can you tell me about them?"</p><p>"May I be blunt, Steve?" It must have been a rhetorical question, because he didn't wait for my answer. "I'm not so sure I am ready to do that."</p><p>That was the last thing I expected Charles Roland to say. "What do you mean?" I said, shocked. "I thought that's why you came to meet me."</p><p>"I said I'm not sure I'm ready yet. I didn't say no."</p><p>I waited for him to continue.</p><p>"I checked you out last night, Steve. Looked through your Web site, read some of your articles and an excerpt from one of your books. I think I have a pretty good sense of who you are--professionally, anyway."</p><p>"Okay. Good, I guess. But what's my work got to do with this?"</p><p>"You'll find it's got everything to do with it--that is, if you are who your materials claim you to be."</p><p>"Okay," I said, annoyed but still intrigued. "Why are you being so cryptic? Am I going to learn about these people or not?"</p><p>"My apologies, Mr. Farber, for being so vague. Here's the situation: For one thing, I'm very protective of the privacy of the individuals involved here--one of them, in particular, with whom I work. I'm sure you understand."</p><p>"Okay," I said.</p><p>"I don't want to waste their time with a . . . what . . . curiosity seeker. Any interaction with them needs to be . . . I guess I'd call it . . . meaningful for them."</p><p>"Meaningful," I repeated.</p><p>"Yes. But I believe there's a value in this for you, too, far beyond what you expected when you contacted me."</p><p>"Really," I said, more than a little skeptical now. "In what way?"</p><p>"I'm referring to a principle that made their relationship so special in the first place. Something was put in place between them that has developed into a philosophy of life that goes way beyond GZ, as you call him, and his young student. And given the kind of leadership work you do, it may be well worth your while to learn and understand the principle before you meet the people behind it. And, in fact, I've been authorized to say that neither one has any interest in sharing their story with you until and unless you grasp this principle first. Are you interested, Steve?" Again, he didn't wait for my answer. "Because if you are, I'm willing to teach you about it. And if you're not . . ."</p></p><h2>Hilda and the Nowhere Space: Hilda Netflix Tie-In 3 (Hilda Tie-In)</h2><p><b>Caught up on <i>Hilda</i> on Netflix?

But no modern translation has yet captured the essential thrust of Lao Tzu's work as a practical guide to living an awakened life. Now William Martin, whose acclaimed previous reinterpretations of the Tao (for parents, couples, and elders) have introduced or reacquainted this classic text to thousands of readers, strikingly translates the Tao's eighty-one chapters to uniquely address someone on a Tao&#x2014;or path&#x2014;with a practice. Martin frames his new translation with two illuminating, groundbreaking sections: "A Path," which introduces the Tao's nonlinear construction and explains how it works its themes; and "A Practice," which provides practical guidance for readers exploring each of the Tao's themes in depth. Martin's genius in this new translation uncovers how directly the Tao speaks to readers on or about to embark on a spiritual journey.</p><p>WILLIAM MARTIN has been a student of the Tao for almost twenty years.

It was unlike any other garden she knew. It had no flowers or vegetables. Instead, Ojiichan made it out of stones: ?big ones, little ones and ones in-between.? Every summer, Mayumi visits her grandfather in Japan, and they tend the garden together. Raking the gravel is her favorite part. Afterward, the two of them sit on a bench and enjoy the results of their efforts in happy silence. But then one summer, everything changes. Ojiichan has grown too old to care for his home and the garden. He has to move. Will Mayumi find a way to keep the memory of the garden alive for both of them? <br><br>This gentle picture book story will warm children's hearts as it explores a deep intergenerational bond and the passing of knowledge from grandparent to grandchild over time. The lyrical text by Chieri Uegaki and luminous watercolor illustrations by Genevieve Simms beautifully capture the emotional arc of the story, from Mayumi's contentment through her anger and disappointment to, finally, her acceptance. The story focuses on an important connection to nature, particularly as a place for quiet reflection. It contains character education lessons on caring, responsibility, perseverance and initiative. It's also a wonderful way to introduce social studies conversations about family, aging and multiculturalism. Mayumi lives in North America with her Japanese mother and Dutch father, and visits her grandfather in Japan.

Hiroko Tanaka watches her lover from the veranda as he leaves. Sunlight streams across Urakami Valley, and then the world goes white.</p><p>In the devastating aftermath of the atomic bomb, Hiroko leaves Japan in search of new beginnings. From Delhi, amid India's cry for independence from British colonial rule, to New York City in the immediate wake of 9/11, to the novel's astonishing climax in Afghanistan, a violent history casts its shadow the entire world over. Sweeping in its scope and mesmerizing in its evocation of time and place, this is a tale of love and war, of three generations, and three world-changing historic events. Kamila Shamsie's <i>Burnt Shadows</i> is a story for our time by "a writer of immense ambition and strength. . . . This is an absorbing novel that commands in the reader a powerful emotional and intellectual response" (Salman Rushdie).</p></p><p><b>KAMILA SHAMSIE</b> was born in 1973 in Karachi. She has studied and taught in the USA. Two of her previous novels, <i>Kartography </i>and <i>Broken Verses</i>, have won awards from Pakistan's Academy of Letters. She writes for <i>The Guardian</i> (UK) and frequently broadcasts on the BBC.Later, the one who survives will remember that day as grey, but on the morning of 9 August itself both the man from Berlin, Konrad Weiss, and the schoolteacher, Hiroko Tanaka, step out of their houses and notice the perfect blueness of the sky, into which white smoke blooms from the chimneys of the munitions factories.<br><br>Konrad cannot see the chimneys themselves from his home in Minamiyamate, but for months now his thoughts have frequently wandered to the factory where Hiroko Tanaka spends her days measuring the thickness of steel with micrometers, images of classrooms swooping into her thoughts the way memories of flight might enter the minds of broken-winged birds. That morning, though, as Konrad slides open the doors that form the front and back of his small wooden caretaker&#x2019;s house and looks in the direction of the smoke he makes no attempt to imagine the scene unfolding wearily on the factory floor. Hiroko has a day off &#x2013; a holiday, her supervisor called it, though everyone in the factory knows there is no steel left to measure. And still so many people in Nagasaki continue to think Japan will win the war. Konrad imagines conscripts sent out at night to net the clouds and release them in the morning through factory chimneys to create the illusion of industry.<br><br>He steps on to the back porch of the house. Green and brown leaves are scattered across the grass of the large property, as though the area is a battlefield in which the soldiers of warring armies have lain down, caring for nothing in death but proximity. He looks up the slope towards Azalea Manor; in the weeks since the Kagawas departed, taking their household staff with them, everything has started to look rundown. One of the window shutters is partly ajar; when the wind picks up it takes to banging against the sill. He should secure the shutter, he knows, but it comforts him to have some sound of activity issuing from the house.<br><br>Azalea Manor. In &#x2019;38 when he stepped for the first time through its sliding doors into a grand room of marble floor and Venetian fireplace it was the photographs along the wall that had captured his attention rather than the mad mixture of Japanese and European architectural styles: all taken in the grounds of Azalea Manor while some party was in progress, Europeans and Japanese mixing uncomplicatedly. He had believed the promise of the photographs and felt unaccustomedly grateful to his English brother-in-law James Burton who had told him weeks earlier that he was no longer welcome at the Burton home in Delhi with the words, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a property in Nagasaki. Belonged to George &#x2013; an eccentric bachelor uncle of mine who died there a few months ago. Some Jap keeps sending me telegrams asking what&#x2019;s to be done with it. Why don&#x2019;t you live there for a while? As long as you like.&#x201d; Konrad knew nothing about Nagasaki &#x2013; except, to its credit, that it was not Europe and it was not where James and Ilse lived &#x2013; and when he sailed into the harbour of the purple-roofed city laid out like an amphitheatre he felt he was entering a world of enchantment. Seven years later much of the enchantment remains &#x2013; the glassy loveliness of frost flowers in winter, seas of blue azaleas in summer, the graceful elegance of the Euro-Japanese buildings along the seafront &#x2013; but war fractures every view. Or closes off the view completely. Those who go walking in the hills have been warned against looking down towards the shipyard where the battleship <i>Musashi </i>is being built under such strict secrecy that heavy curtains have been constructed to block its view from all passers-by.<br><br>Functional, Hiroko Tanaka thinks, as she stands on the porch of her house in Urakami and surveys the terraced slopes, the still morning alive with the whirring of cicadas. If there were an adjective to best describe how war has changed Nagasaki, she decides, that would be it. Everything distilled or distorted into its most functional form. She walked past the vegetable patches on the slopes a few days ago and saw the earth itself furrowing in mystification: why potatoes where once there were azaleas? What prompted this falling-off of love? How to explain to the earth that it was more functional as a vegetable patch than a flower garden, just as factories were more functional than schools and boys were more functional as weapons than as humans.<br><br>An old man walks past with skin so brittle Hiroko thinks of a paper lantern with the figure of a man drawn on to it. She wonders how she looks to him, or to anyone. To Konrad. Just a gaunt figure in the drabbest of clothes like everyone else, she guesses, recalling with a smile Konrad&#x2019;s admission that when he first saw her &#x2013; dressed then, as now, in white shirt and grey monpe &#x2013; he had wanted to paint her. Not paint a portrait of her, he added quickly. But the striking contrast she formed with the lush green of the Kagawas&#x2019; well-tended garden across which she had walked towards him ten months ago made him wish for buckets of thick, vibrant paint to pour on to her, waterfalls of colour cascading from her shoulders (rivers of blue down her shirt, pools of orange at her feet, emerald and ruby rivulets intersecting along her arms).<br><br>&#x201c;I wish you had,&#x201d; she said, taking his hand. &#x201c;I would have seen the craziness beneath the veneer much sooner.&#x201d; He slipped his hand out of hers with a glance that mixed apology and rebuke. The military police could come upon them at any moment.<br><br>The man with the brittle skin turns to look back at her, touching his own face as if trying to locate the young man beneath the wrinkles. He has seen this neighbourhood girl &#x2013; the traitor&#x2019;s daughter &#x2013; several times in the last few months and each time it seems that the hunger they are all inhabiting conspires to make her more beautiful: the roundness of her childhood face has melted away completely to reveal the exquisiteness of sharply angled cheekbones, a mole resting just atop one of them. But somehow she escapes all traces of harshness, particularly when, as now, her mouth curves up on one side, and a tiny crease appears just millimetres from the edge of the smile, as though marking a boundary which becomes visible only if you try to slip past it. The old man shakes his head, aware of the foolishness he is exhibiting in staring at the young woman who is entirely unaware of him, but grateful, too, for something in the world which can still prompt foolishness in him.<br><br>The metallic cries of the cicadas are upstaged by the sound of the air siren, as familiar now as the call of insects. The New Bomb! the old man thinks, and turns to hurry away to the nearest air-raid shelter, all foolishness forgotten. Hiroko, by contrast, makes a sharp sound of impatience. Already, the day is hot. In the crowded air-raid shelters of Urakami it will be unbearable &#x2013; particularly under the padded air-raid hoods which she views with scepticism but has to wear if she wants to avoid lectures from the Chairman of the Neighbourhood Association about setting a poor example to the children. It is a false alarm &#x2013; it is almost always a false alarm. The other cities of Japan may have suffered heavily in aerial raids, but not Nagasaki. A few weeks ago she repeated to Konrad the received wisdom that Nagasaki would be spared all serious damage because it was the most Christian of Japan&#x2019;s cities, and Konrad pointed out that there were more Christians in Dresden than in Nagasaki. She has started to take the air-raid sirens a little more seriously ever since. But really, it will be so hot in the shelter. Why shouldn&#x2019;t she just stay at home? It is almost certainly a false alarm.<br><br>Why risk it, Konrad thinks. He retrieves his air-raid hood from inside the house and starts to walk swiftly towards the shelter which the Kagawas had built in the back garden. Halfway across the garden he stops and looks at the wall which divides the property from the vacated lot next door. He hasn&#x2019;t checked on his birds, on the other side of the wall, since the last rain shower. Tossing the air-raid hood on the grass, he strides to the boundary wall and hoists himself over it, slinging his body low to reduce the chances of being seen by passers-by or the military police.<br><br>If anyone were to see him they would think he looked ridiculous &#x2013; a gangling European tumbling over a wall, all arms and legs and hooded eyes, with hair and close-cropped beard of a colour so unexpected in Nagasaki that Hiroko Tanaka had thought, the first time she saw him, that the hair of Europeans rusted rather than greyed as they aged. Later she discovered that he was only twenty-nine &#x2013; eight years older than she was.<br><br>The dry grass crackles beneath his feet &#x2013; he feels as though he is snapping the backs of tiny creatures &#x2013; as he walks across to the giant camphor tree to which the birds are fastened, rotating slowly in the faint breeze. It is Hiroko who first referred to his purple notebooks as birds &#x2013; the day they met; the only time she has been inside his house. She lifted a notebook off his desk, splayed, and glided it around his room. The animation of her touch made him acutely conscious of the lifelessness of his words: sentences thrown down on paper year after year simply so he could pretend there was some purpose to his being here, some excuse for cowering in a world from which he felt so separate that nothing in it could ever implicate him.<br><br>But ever since Germany&#x2019;s surrender shifted his status in Nagasaki from that of ally into some more ambiguous state which requires the military police to watch him closely the lifeless words have become potent enough to send him to prison. It says all there is to say about the paranoia of Imperial Japan: notebooks of research and observation about the cosmopolitan world that had briefly existed within a square mile of where he now lives are evidence of treason. Yoshi Watanabe made that clear to him when Germany&#x2019;s surrender started to seem imminent. <i>You write about ...</i></p><h2>GP454 - Essential Piano Repertoire of the 17th, 18th, &amp; 19th Centuries - Level 4 (Neil A Kjos Piano Library Book &amp; CD)</h2><p>Essential Piano Repertoire provides piano students with carefully chosen collections of the very best keyboard literature from the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries.

But can anthropologists' studies of small-scale systems contribute to policies that address profoundly interconnected global problems? Townsend explores this question in her concise introduction to environmental anthropology.<p> While maintaining the structure and clarity of previous editions, the third edition has been thoroughly revised to include new research. Newly added are a chapter on the environmental impact of war and recommended readings and films. Townsend begins with a historical overview of the field, illustrating how earlier ideas and approaches help to understand how today's populations adapt to their physical and biological environments. She then transitions to a closer look at global environmental issues, including such topics as rapid expansion of the world economic system and inequality, loss of biodiversity and its implications for human health, and injustices of climate change, resource extraction, and toxic waste disposal. The final chapters caution that meaningful change requires social movements and policy changes in addition to individual actions.</p><p> Title of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Netting, <i>Cultural Ecology,</i> 2E (ISBN 9780881332049).</p></p><p>"It is an excellent choice for introducing the anthropological approach in an environmental studies course or curriculum and can be strongly recommended for that purpose.

I truly cannot elucidate the many advantages and sheer comprehensiveness of each book (and materials) I have read so far. Charts, for example, that represent the compilation and intensive research of Biblical history always prove to be 100% accurate and often include little or even heretofore unknown facts. Just suffice it to say that every scrap of material I have been privy to always contained amazing surprises and inexhaustible amounts of information - information that specifically enhances and illuminates every person who utilizes them. They have already made huge impacts of so many young and mature Christians. Several of the people I have mentored through their doctoral studies have sworn by these materials as one of the best sources they have ever seen. I agree with them completely.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive Essay: When Spycraft Is Not Crafty Enough by Ben Macintyre</strong><br> <b>Click on Thumbnail to Enlarge</b></p> <p></p> <p>Soon after Operation Mincemeat was launched, Britain&#x2019;s spymasters realized they had made a glaring mistake. They tried to correct it and, in the process, made it much worse.</p> <p>In Chapter Seven of <i>Operation Mincemeat</i>, I identified various "hostages to fortune" left by the planners of the deception--most importantly, the fake, dated letter from Bill Martin&#x2019;s "father," handwritten on the writing paper of a Welsh Hotel.</p> <p>"The plot would never have stood up to scrutiny if German spies in Britain had made even the most cursory checks on it," I wrote. "A glance at the hotel register for the Black Lion Hotel would have showed that no J. C. Martin had stayed there on the night of April 13."</p> <p>Two weeks after <i>Operation Mincemeat</i> was published, I received a telephone call at <i>The Times</i>, of the sort that non-fiction writers both welcome--and dread.</p> <p>"I happen to have the hotel register for the Black Lion," said the Welsh voice on the other end. "And if you look at the page for April, 1943, you will clearly see the name J. C. Martin."</p> <p>I was flabbergasted, and my respect for the planners of Operation Mincemeat rose another notch. They had thought of everything: they had even dispatched someone to Mold, in North Wales, to stay at the hotel and pose as the fictional father of a fictional officer, simply to ensure that the hotel register looked correct if anyone came snooping afterwards. That was true spycraft.</p> <p>When the caller sent me a photograph of the page from the register, I studied it carefully. The handwriting was that of Charles Cholmondeley, the originator and co-creator of Operation Mincemeat. The false address given for "J. C. Martin" was Scotts House, Eynsham, in Oxfordshire (now a daycare center). </p> <p>The faked letter in Major Martin&#x2019;s pocket clearly indicated that "Father" had been staying at the hotel for some time ("the only alternative to imposing myself once more on your aunt"). The register indicated that he had arrived at the hotel on April 9th, and checked out on the 20th, in time for the fake meeting with his son in London.</p> <p>So far, so convincing.</p> <p>But closer examination revealed something very odd. The name and signature of J. C. Martin did not appear in the correct date sequence, but was added in the space at the bottom of the page. It was clearly an afterthought, written in sometime afterwards. To even the most casual investigator this would have set off loud alarm bells: so far from covering up the mistake, Cholmondeley had compounded it, by drawing attention to the fact that there was something distinctly out of the ordinary about John Martin and his sojourn at the Black Lion.</p> <p>One can speculate about what must have happened. As Mincemeat got underway, the planners began to realize that it was working far more effectively that they had dared to hope. They began to wonder and worry about possible loose ends. The coroner, Bentley Purchase, was contacted again and quizzed over whether, if the Germans exhumed the body and carried out another post mortem, they would be able tell that Martin had died of poisoning, rather than drowning. (He was confident they would not.)</p> <p>They also, I suspect, took another look at the letters, and sent Cholmondeley to Mold. The result was not a cover-up, but a giveaway. A register without the name J.C.Martin would merely have presented a mystery; a register with the name so obviously added in was patently a botched attempt to deceive.</p> <p>In the end, it did not matter. There is no evidence that the Germans ever carried out any checking of the Bill Martin backstory. Had they attempted to do so, this would almost certainly have been picked up by British intelligence since the entire German espionage system in the U.K. was effectively controlled by MI5. Once the lie was embedded in German strategic thinking, no effort was made to disprove it.</p> <p>Still, it is sobering thought, that if a single German agent had traveled to Mold and examined the register of the Black Lion, he would surely have spotted the obvious addition of &#x201c;J.C.Martin&#x201d;, recognized there was something fishy going on, and warned the Germans before the invasion of Sicily. The island might then have been reinforced, and countless lives might have been lost with incalculable consequences. That single register entry could have changed the course of World War II.</p> <p>One of the great pleasures of writing about this period, is the way that history never stands still. The register of the Black Lion is only one of many fragments that have appeared, since the book was published, to enlarge and complete the story of Operation Mincemeat.</p> <p>The moral for spy-craftsmen? If it ain&#x2019;t broke, don&#x2019;t fix it. And if it cannot be fixed without giving the game away, don&#x2019;t touch it.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Ben Macintyre on <em>Operation Mincemeat</em></strong></p> <p></p> <p><b>Q:</b> What inspired you to write about this little-known story from World War II?<br> <b>A:</b> I first came across the story while researching my last book, <em>Agent Zigzag</em>, about the British criminal and double agent Eddie Chapman. One of his case officers, Ewen Montagu, was the mastermind behind Operation Mincemeat. The more I dug, the more information emerged about this true story, for so long shrouded in myth and mystery.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Was it difficult to make contact with Ewen Montagu&#x2019;s family, and were they helpful in your research?<br> <b>A:</b> The members of the Montagu family were easy to find and hugely helpful; indeed, this book could not have been written without them. After the war, Ewen Montagu retained most of the official papers relating to Operation Mincemeat. After he died, they were put in a wooden trunk, and almost forgotten. In 2007, the family gave me full access to the papers, including the official records, but also memos, letters, photographs, and a 200-page memoir written by Montagu himself.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What was the most interesting/surprising detail that you uncovered as you were gathering information for <i>Operation Mincemeat</i>?<br> <b>A:</b> The most extraordinary aspect of Operation Mincemeat, to my mind, is the way that the organizers approached this elaborate, many-layered deception operation as if they were writing a novel, imagining a version of reality and then luring the truth towards it. Indeed, the talents required for espionage and fiction-writing are not so very different. At the center of the plot was the fictional figure of William Martin: he was equipped with not only false papers but an entirely false personality and past, including a fianc�e, complete with love letters.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> There are a number of fascinating figures in <i>Operation Mincemeat</i>. Which person were you most intrigued by, and why?<br> <b>A:</b> I was particularly fascinated by Charles Cholmondeley, the RAF officer seconded to MI5 who first dreamed up the plan to use a dead body to plant false information on the Germans. Cholmondeley had a long, waxed, air-force mustache, a shy personality, and a very strange mind, but he was a genius at deception work, and the unsung hero of Operation Mincemeat. Unlike other participants, he was modest about the achievement, never told anyone what he had done during the war, and ended up selling lawn mowers in a small town in rural England.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Where did you conduct most of your research, and did you encounter any difficulties or roadblocks along the way?<br> <b>A:</b> This book took me to Spain, France, and the U.S., but most of the research was conducted in British archives and interviewing survivors from that time. Despite Britain&#x2019;s draconian Official Secrecy Act, rather than hindering or obstructing my research, MI5 and MI6 (the security service and secret intelligence service) were extraordinarily helpful. Perhaps the main impediment was time: the events described in the book are now on the furthest tip of living memory, most of the participants are now dead, and in some ways the research was a race to capture the memories of the living before they, too, are gone.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> In the book, you hint that Ewen Montagu (playing Bill) and Jean Leslie (playing Pam) may have taken their roles as "lovers" too seriously. What is your belief about their relationship?<br> <b>A:</b> Whether the imagined courtship between "Bill" and "Pam" was ever more than merely flirtatious banter is unknown, and likely to remain that way. Certainly Ewen was &#x201c;smitten&#x201d; with Jean (her word), and they both played along with their allotted roles. Wartime Britain was filled with fear and danger, but for those in the spying game, it was also a time of great excitement and romance. If the imagined love affair overlapped with reality, that would fit with the story, in which the framers invented a deception so real they began to believe it themselves.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did you have the opportunity to visit the gravestone of Glyndwr Michael/Major William Martin in Huelva? How do you think his family would have felt if they had known the unexpected and important role their son played in the outcome of World War II?<br> <b>A:</b> I did visit the grave in Huelva: it is a most atmospheric and tranquil place, looking down over the port and the shoreline where the body of "William Martin" was found in 1943. Glyndwr Michael&#x2019;s family was a troubled one, crushed by poverty and with a history of mental illness. I think they would have been astonished and delighted in equal measure that Glyndwr played such a crucial role in history, albeit posthumously, and through no choice of his own.</p> <br>Ben Macintyre is a columnist and Associate Editor on The Times.

He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.<br></p><i>Chapter One<br></i><br>BLACK ICE COATED EARTH FROZEN HARD BY NIGHT&nbsp;temperatures that had dropped below freezing, a thin skein&nbsp;of slickness that challenged the grip of his toughened- rawhide&nbsp;boot soles. Yet the Gray Man stepped with grace and ease across the&nbsp;treacherous smoothness, not oblivious to the danger so much as accustomed&nbsp;to it. He passed through the woods along the snow line close by&nbsp;the valley&#x2019;s rim, only slightly less transparent than the wraiths to which&nbsp;he was so often compared. Amid the dark of the trunks and limbs and&nbsp;the deep green of the conifer needles, he was another of night&#x2019;s shadows.&nbsp;Until you got close enough to realize he wasn&#x2019;t a figment of the&nbsp;imagination, but as substantial as the rumors that tracked him in whispers&nbsp;and long silences, and then he was something much more.&nbsp;<br><br>Through the night&#x2019;s slow retreat he passed, watching daybreak&nbsp;lighten the sky above the eastern rim of the valley, so far away it was&nbsp;little more than a hazy glow. He had been walking for several hours, his&nbsp;sleep ended early. Each day found him someplace else, and even&nbsp;though he followed the same route over and over, tracking the rim of&nbsp;the valley from mountain peak to barren ridge to escarpment and back&nbsp;again, he was never bothered by time or speed; only with order. It was&nbsp;given to him to navigate the heights from one mountain pass to another,&nbsp;one valley&#x2019;s passage to the next, always in search of an opening&nbsp;that led out&#x2014;or in. The mists that had sealed the valley since the time&nbsp;of the Hawk had not yet receded, but that would change and it would&nbsp;do so in his lifetime.&nbsp;<br><br>His dreams had told him so.&nbsp;<br><br>The wall that kept the survivors of the Great Wars safely sealed in,&nbsp;and the things that roamed the world beyond locked out, would not&nbsp;hold forever, although there were many who thought differently. The&nbsp;wall was a conjuration of power unlike any he could imagine, although&nbsp;he wielded considerable power of his own. But nothing was permanent;&nbsp;all things must change. And no matter the beliefs of some and&nbsp;the wishes of others, life had a way of surprising you.&nbsp;<br><br>A hawk screamed from somewhere high above, soaring across the&nbsp;snowfields and rocky promontories, and something in the sound of&nbsp;that cry reminded the Gray Man that time slipped away and the past&nbsp;was catching up.&nbsp;<br><br>He quickened his pace, moving silently through the deep woods,&nbsp;his tattered robes trailing from his lean form. He did not stride through&nbsp;the trees so much as flow, a spectral creature formed of bits and pieces&nbsp;of color and smoke, of aether and light. He touched things as he went,&nbsp;small brushings and tiny rubs of fingertips, nothing more, reading from&nbsp;each something of the world about him. He sniffed the air and studied&nbsp;the look of the tiny ends of branches. Everything spoke to him. A Koden&nbsp;had passed here. There was fresh springwater not far away over there.&nbsp;Fledgling ravens had departed the nest last summer and flown off to&nbsp;breed families of their own. A family of black squirrels lived within&nbsp;that stand of blue spruce, perhaps watching him as he passed. It was all&nbsp;there for those who might read it, but he was one of only a handful&nbsp;who could.&nbsp;<br><br>After all, it was in his blood.&nbsp;<br><br>He was tall and rangy in the way of mountain men and long- range&nbsp;Trackers from the communities of Men and Elves alike, and broadshouldered&nbsp;and hard in the way of the Lizards, though not burdened&nbsp;with the armor of their skin. He was quick when he needed to be and&nbsp;slow when quickness could get you killed. He was dangerous all the&nbsp;time. There were stories about him in every settlement, every village,&nbsp;every safehold and way station, and he had heard them all. Some were&nbsp;partly true, though none told all his tale. He was one of a kind and&nbsp;the last, as well&#x2014;unless he found the next bearer. It was something he&nbsp;thought of now and then. But time allowed for little deviation from his&nbsp;duty, least of all seeking out and training the successor whom he fervently&nbsp;hoped he would not need for some years to come.&nbsp;<br><br>His hands tightened about the black staff that marked him for who&nbsp;and what he was, conscious of the deep carving of its runes and the&nbsp;pulse of the magic they commanded. He did not call upon the power&nbsp;much these days, did not have cause to do so, but it was comforting to&nbsp;know that it was there. The Word&#x2019;s magic was given to him by his&nbsp;predecessor and before that by his, and so on over a span of five centuries.&nbsp;He knew the story of its origins; all those who carried the staff&nbsp;knew. They passed it on dutifully. Or when time and events did not&nbsp;allow for an orderly passage, they learned it another way. The Gray&nbsp;Man was not familiar with the experiences of those others who had&nbsp;borne the staff; he knew only his own. He had never been visited by&nbsp;the Lady who served as the voice of the staff&#x2019;s maker. She had never&nbsp;come to him in his dreams as she had sometimes come to others.&nbsp;<br><br>Ahead, the trees thinned as the valley slope lifted toward a tall, narrow&nbsp;gap in the cliff face farther up. There, hidden within the rocks, the&nbsp;pass at Declan Reach opened through to the larger world. He had&nbsp;stood in its shelter at the edge of his and looked past into the gray&nbsp;nothingness beyond, wondering what that world might look like if he&nbsp;could pass through. He had attempted passage once or twice in the beginning,&nbsp;when he was young and not yet convinced that things were as&nbsp;everyone claimed. But his efforts were always rebuffed; the mists&nbsp;turned him around and sent him back again, no matter how straight he&nbsp;believed the path on which he had set his feet, no matter how determined&nbsp;his attempt. The magic was inexorable, and it refused all&nbsp;equally.&nbsp;<br><br>But now he had the dreams to consider, and the dreams told him&nbsp;that five centuries of what had once seemed forever were coming to a&nbsp;close.&nbsp;<br><br>He left the trees and began to climb. Fresh snow had fallen a day&nbsp;earlier, and its white carpet was pristine and unmarked. But he sensed&nbsp;something nevertheless, a presence hidden below, just out of sight. He&nbsp;could not tell what it was yet, but it was nothing he recognized. He&nbsp;quickened his pace, suddenly worried. He climbed swiftly through the&nbsp;rocky outcroppings and narrow defiles, testing the air as he went, trailing&nbsp;his hands across the rocks. Something had passed this way, descending&nbsp;from the heights. Two, perhaps three days ago, it had made its&nbsp;way down into the valley. Down, not up.&nbsp;<br><br>But down from where?&nbsp;<br><br>His worst fears were realized as he reached the entrance to the pass&nbsp;and found his wards not simply broken, but shredded. The wards had&nbsp;been strong, a network of forbidding he had placed there himself not a&nbsp;month earlier. Wards of the same strength and consistency he used at&nbsp;every such passage leading into the valley, wards intended to warn him&nbsp;of breaches in the wall, wards meant to keep the inhabitants safe from&nbsp;the unthinkable.&nbsp;<br><br>And now the unthinkable was here.&nbsp;<br><br>He knelt to study the area surrounding the tattered remains that&nbsp;still clung to the rocks where he had attached them. He took a long&nbsp;time, wanting to make certain of what he was sensing. There was no&nbsp;mistake. Something had come through from the larger world, from beyond&nbsp;his valley. More than one something, he revised. Two, he&nbsp;judged&#x2014;a hunting pair come in search of food, huge, dangerous creatures&nbsp;from the size and depth of the claw marks on the rocks and the&nbsp;apparent ease with which they had destroyed the wards.&nbsp;<br><br>He stood up, shaking his head at the irony of it. Even as he had&nbsp;tried to measure the time allotted before the dreams would come to&nbsp;pass, they had arrived full- blown. In the blink of an eye, the past was&nbsp;upon them.&nbsp;<br><br>He looked out from his vantage point high upon the snow line to&nbsp;the spread of the valley. Mist and clouds hid much of it this morning,&nbsp;and it would be midday before that haze burned off enough to permit&nbsp;a view of even the closest of the communities. To which of these&nbsp;would the intruders go? It was impossible to say. They might stay high&nbsp;up on the protective slopes of the mountains. Whatever their choice,&nbsp;he would have to hunt them down and dispatch them before it was&nbsp;too late.&nbsp;<br><br>Which it might already be.&nbsp;<br><br>He turned back into the pass and with the aid of his staff began to&nbsp;rebuild the wards. He summoned the magic, holding out the staff before&nbsp;him and using the words of power and small movements of his&nbsp;hands. The runes began to glow, luminous against the still- dark early&nbsp;morning, pulsing softly in response to his commands. He felt the&nbsp;power flow from the staff into his body, and as always he was transported&nbsp;to another plateau of sensation, one that was too close to euphoria&nbsp;for comfort, a warning of an addiction he had already embraced too&nbsp;closely. The magic was an elixir, each time giving him such fulfillment,&nbsp;such satisfaction, that he could barely stand the thought of letting it go.&nbsp;But he had learned what the lure could result in, and by now, he knew&nbsp;the ways in which to keep from falling prey.&nbsp;<br><br>Or so he told himself.&nbsp;<br><br>He layered the pass with the wards, preventing the creatures that&nbsp;had broken through from escaping the valley without his knowing.&nbsp;It took him a while to complete the task, for he understood the importance&nbsp;of being thorough. But when at last he finished, the wards&nbsp;were set. He let the magic retreat back into the staff. The brightness of&nbsp;the runes faded, the glaze of the magic&#x2019;s euphoria dissipated, and the&nbsp;world returned to normal.&nbsp;<br><br>The Gray Man stood where he was for long moments afterward,&nbsp;savoring the memories, and then he turned his back on the pass and&nbsp;the wards and set out along the valley rim, tracking the creatures.&nbsp;It was not difficult to do so. They were big and slow, and their&nbsp;tracks were distinct where imprinted in muddy patches on the rocks&nbsp;and within the snowfield. They were moving west now, opposite the&nbsp;direction from which he had come. They followed the snow line for&nbsp;only a short distance before dropping down to the deep woods and&nbsp;their protective cover. They were hunting still, the Gray Man guessed,&nbsp;but keeping close to the safety of the heights and some assurance of&nbsp;the way back. They were thinking creatures, though he doubted their&nbsp;ability to reason overrode their primal instincts. They were brutes, and&nbsp;they would react as such. A lack of caution did not make them any less&nbsp;dangerous. If anything, it made them more so. He would need to find&nbsp;them quickly.&nbsp;<br><br>He considered for a moment the ramifications of their presence. It&nbsp;meant that after all these years, the wall was failing and their time of&nbsp;isolation was at an end. This would be difficult for many of the valley&#x2019;s&nbsp;inhabitants to accept&#x2014;Men, Elves, Lizards, Spiders, and those singular&nbsp;creatures that lacked a group identity. It would be impossible for some.&nbsp;The sect of Men who called themselves the Children of the Hawk, and&nbsp;who awaited the return of the leader who had brought them to the valley&nbsp;to protect them, would resist any suggestion of an end to the mists&nbsp;that did not involve his coming. Their dogma prophesied that the wall&nbsp;would endure until it was safe to leave the valley and the Hawk returned&nbsp;to lead them out again. Anything else they would call heresy;&nbsp;they would fight against it until the evidence stood before them, and&nbsp;even then they might not believe. Nothing anyone could say would&nbsp;change minds so settled; belief in the invisible, belief founded solely on&nbsp;faith, did not allow for that.&nbsp;<br><br>Yet he would have to try. There was no one else who would do so,&nbsp;if he did not.&nbsp;<br><br>He glanced downslope out of habit, recalling that the Seraphic&nbsp;who led the Children of the Hawk made his home in Glensk Wood.&nbsp;How ironic it would be if the creatures from the outer world were to&nbsp;somehow make their way to his community and introduce themselves.&nbsp;Would the members of the sect believe then?&nbsp;<br><br>Bittersweet memories flooded his mind in a sudden rush and then&nbsp;dissipated like morning mist.&nbsp;<br><br>The day brightened as the hours passed, and the sun broke through&nbsp;the clouds to warm the air. The brume clung to the higher elevations,&nbsp;catching on peaks and nestling in defiles, and shadows gathered in the&nbsp;deep woods in dark pools. Now that the creatures had left the snow,&nbsp;the Gray Man could track them less easily. But they left traces of their&nbsp;scent and surface marks so that following them was possible for someone&nbsp;with his skills.&nbsp;<br><br>By now he had concluded that he was at least twenty- four hours&nbsp;behind them. It was too long for creatures of this size not to have&nbsp;found something to eat. He had to hope that whatever they had found&nbsp;did not walk on two legs, and that was hoping for a lot. Trappers and&nbsp;hunters roamed these hills year- round in search of game. Some made&nbsp;their homes in cabins up along the snow line; some had their families&nbsp;with them. They were tough, experienced men and women, but they&nbsp;were no match for the ones he tracked.&nbsp;<br><br>It frustrated him to think that this was happening now, that the&nbsp;ending of the barrier had come about so abruptly. There should have&nbsp;been some warning, some hint that change was at hand. Wasn&#x2019;t that&nbsp;what the Seraphic preached? But no one was prepared for this; no one&nbsp;would know what to do. Not even himself, he acknowledged. How do&nbsp;you prepare for the intrusion of a world you had escaped because it&nbsp;was too monstrous to live in? How do you prepare for an end to everything&nbsp;you had believed to be permanent?&nbsp;<br><br>He smiled grimly. It was too bad he couldn&#x2019;t ask his predecessors,&nbsp;those fortunate few who had found a way to survive the horrors of the&nbsp;Great Wars when it had seemed survival was impossible. They would&nbsp;know.&nbsp;<br><br>The ground ahead had turned damp and spongy, the snowmelt&nbsp;trickling off the heights in dozens of tiny streams. The Gray Man studied&nbsp;the ground carefully as he went, seeking the tiny indicators of his&nbsp;quarry&#x2019;s passing, finding them less quickly now, their presence faded&nbsp;with the changes in temperature and time&#x2019;s passage. As he slipped&nbsp;silently through the trees, he could hear birds singing and tiny animals&nbsp;rushing about, and he knew that they would not be doing so if any sort&nbsp;of danger were present. He had not lost ground; he had simply failed&nbsp;to make it up. The creatures were traveling faster at this point, perhaps&nbsp;because they sensed the possibility of food.

Nikita Khrushchev was one of the most complex and important political figures of the twentieth century. Ruler of the Soviet Union during the first decade after Stalin's death, Khrushchev left a contradictory stamp on his country and on the world. His life and career mirror the Soviet experience: revolution, civil war, famine, collectivization, industrialization, terror, world war, cold war, Stalinism, post-Stalinism. Complicit in terrible Stalinist crimes, Khrushchev nevertheless retained his humanity: his daring attempt to reform communism prepared the ground for its eventual collapse; and his awkward efforts to ease the cold war triggered its most dangerous crises. </p> <p> This is the first comprehensive biography of Khrushchev and the first of any Soviet leader to reflect the full range of sources that have become available since the USSR collapsed. Combining a page-turning historical narrative with penetrating political and psychological analysis, this book brims with the life and excitement of a man whose story personified his era. </p></p><p>William Taubman is the Bertrand Snell Professor of Political Science Emeritus at Amherst College. His biography, Khrushchev: The Man and His Era, won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. He lives in Amherst, Massachusetts.Amherst College political science professor Taubman's thorough and nuanced account is the first full-length American biography of Khrushchev-and will likely be the definitive one for a long time. Russians, Taubman explains, are still divided by Khrushchev's legacy, largely because of the great contradiction at the heart of his career: he worked closely with Stalin for nearly 20 years, approved thousands of arrests and executions, and continued to idolize the dictator until the latter's death. Yet it was Khrushchev who publicly revealed the enormity of Stalin's crimes, denounced him, and introduced reforms that, Taubman argues, "allowed a nascent civil society to take shape"-eventually making way for perestroika. Taubman untangles the fascinating layers of deception and self-deception in Khrushchev's own memoir, weighing just how much the leader was likely to have known about the purges and his own culpability in them. He also shows that shadows of Stalinism lingered through Khrushchev's 11 years in power: his fourth-grade education left him both awed and threatened by the Russian intelligentsia, which he persecuted; intending to de-escalate the Cold War, the mercurial, blustering first secretary ended up provoking dangerous standoffs with the U.S. The bumbling, equivocal speeches quoted here make Khrushchev seem a rank amateur in international affairs-or, as Taubman politely puts it, he had trouble "thinking things through." Working closely with Khrushchev's children, and interviewing his surviving top-level Central Committee colleagues and aides, Taubman has pieced together a remarkably detailed chronicle, complete with riveting scenes of Kremlin intrigue and acute psychological analysis that further illuminates some of the nightmarish episodes of Soviet history. 32 pages of photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Game-Day Eats: 100 Recipes for Homegating Like a Pro</h2><p><p><strong>Create epic feasts for game days at home with this full-color cookbook from former NFL star and celebrity chef Eddie Jackson that includes 100 fresh and inventive recipes for tailgating at home.<br></strong><br>There&#x2019;s nothing like day full of football and great food.

To help out with the family, he was put to work when he was 10 years old in his father's candle and soap-making shop. Ben hated making soap and candles. Since he was smart and a good speller and he loved to read, he later went to work in his brother's print shop as an apprentice. He read book after book, and soon began to write himself. By 18, he moved to Philadelphia where he eventually openend his own print shop. By age 28 he published "Poor Richard's Almanac," a best seller in Colonial America.</p><p>Following the format of his picture-book biographies of George Washington (1992) and Thomas Jefferson (1994), Giblin, ably aided by artist Michael Dooling, presents the life of Benjamin Franklin--and an amazing life it was. Apprenticed to his brother as a printer, Franklin was soon running his own business and writing his own books, including the popular <i>Poor Richard's Almanack</i>. When Franklin became wealthy enough to retire, his life was just beginning. He indulged himself in his passion for science, worked for public improvements, such as libraries and hospitals, and, of course, became one of the nation's founding fathers as he tirelessly devoting himself to the affairs of a fledgling nation. Giblin's writing is lively, and he wisely uses the story of Franklin's estrangement from his only living son, a Royalist, to heighten dramatic tension. Dooling provides both expertly executed paintings and simple line drawings to bring Franklin's story close to today's readers. An especially useful touch is the wealth of back matter. Besides the expected time line and narrative bibliography, there is a page about Franklin's inventions, another with sayings from <i>Poor Richard's Almanack</i>, a list of historic sites associated with Franklin, and an informative illustrator's note. More than enough material for report writers but an intriguing offering for biography lovers as well. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>Grade 3-6-In a concise, readable style, this biography presents a great deal of information about a key figure in American history. Like Jean Fritz's What's the Big Idea, Ben Franklin? (Putnam, 1976), the book does not romanticize or sentimentalize Franklin's genius or his contributions. Giblin includes the challenges Franklin faced in establishing himself in business, his falling out with his son when they took different sides in the Revolutionary War, and the illnesses he suffered throughout his later years, and balances them with the man's successes in publishing, his inventions, and his diplomatic service. Dooling's realistic full-color, full-page paintings and spot sketches capture not only Franklin, his family, and colleagues, but also reveal much about life in the Colonies and England during this period. Concluding informational pages include a chronology of Franklin's life, a discussion of his inventions, a page of sayings from Poor Richard's Almanack, descriptions of historical sites associated with Franklin, and notes on sources used by both the biographer and the illustrator. These additions enrich and expand on the text.

Before reaching this level of economic success and social assimilation, however, Asian immigrants' path was full of difficult, even demeaning, moments. This book provides a sweeping and nuanced history of Asian Americans, revealing how and why the perception of Asian immigrants changed over time.<br><br>Asian migrants, in large part Chinese, arrived in significant numbers on the West Coast during the 1850s and 1860s to work in gold mining and on the construction of the transcontinental Railroad. Unlike their contemporary European counterparts, Asians, often stigmatized as "coolies," challenged American ideals of equality with the problem of whether all racial groups could be integrated into America's democracy. The fear of the "Yellow Peril" soon spurred an array of legislative and institutional efforts to segregate them through immigration laws, restrictions on citizenship, and limits on employment, property ownership, access to public services, and civil rights. Prejudices against Asian Americans reached a peak during World War II, when Japanese Americans were interned en masse. It was only with changes in the immigration laws and the social and political activism of the 1960s and 1970s that Asian Americans gained ground and acceptance, albeit in the still stereotyped category of "model minorities."<br><br>Madeline Y. Hsu weaves a fascinating historical narrative of this "American Dream." She shows how Asian American success, often attributed to innate cultural values, is more a result of the immigration laws, which have largely pre-selected immigrants of high economic and social potential. Asian Americans have, in turn, been used by politicians to bludgeon newer (and more populous) immigrant groups for their purported lack of achievement. Hsu deftly reveals how public policy, which can restrict and also selectively promote certain immigrant populations, is a key reason why some immigrant groups appear to be more naturally successful and why the identity of those groups evolves differently from others.<br></p><p><br><strong>Madeline Y. Hsu </strong>has served as director of the Center for Asian American Studies and is currently an Associate Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin.

Aren't there two sides to the word? And two opposing sides...It's what we let in, but it's also what we let out." <br><br>For years, 38-year-old Portia Nathan has avoided the past, hiding behind her busy (and sometimes punishing) career as a Princeton University admissions officer and her dependable domestic life. Her reluctance to confront the truth is suddenly overwhelmed by the resurfacing of a life-altering decision, and Portia is faced with an extraordinary test. Just as thousands of the nation's brightest students await her decision regarding their academic admission, so too must Portia decide whether to make her own ultimate admission.<br><br><i>Admission</i> is at once a fascinating look at the complex college admissions process and an emotional examination of what happens when the secrets of the past return and shake a woman's life to its core. <br><br> <em>*Includes Reading Group Guide*</em></p><p>Jean Hanff Korelitz was born and raised in New York and graduated from Dartmouth College and Clare College, Cambridge.

She has also published essays in the anthologies MODERN LOVE and BECAUSE I SAID SO, and in the magazines VOGUE, REAL SIMPLE, MORE, NEWSWEEK, ORGANIC STYLE, TRAVEL AND LEISURE (FAMILY) and others. She lives in Princeton, NJ with her husband (Irish poet Paul Muldoon, poetry editor at <em>The New Yorker </em>and Princeton poetry professor) and two children.<br><br>Portia Nathan, the overly dedicated 38-year-old Princeton admissions officer, narrator of Korelitz's overthought fourth novel, finds purpose in her gatekeeper role. But her career and conscience are challenged after she visits a down-at-the-heels New England town on a scouting trip and meets Jeremiah, a talented but rough-around-the-edges 17-year-old who maybe doesn't measure up as Princeton material. The real rub is how making his acquaintance forces Portia to confront a painful secret from her past that ties into some domestic discord with her professor friend, David, and may lead her into a career-endangering fracas with the admissions board. The narrative is slow out of the gate, though it gets some pep once the Jeremiah-Portia angle comes into focus. And even if Portia tends to ruminate in an precious way, Korelitz makes good use of the sociological issues tied up in elite university admissions. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Set majestically against the rose, purple, and deep blue of the dusky sky, the blazing torch of the rocket lit up the approaching night for miles around.

Through centuries of crises and opportunities, many have taken up this theme to inspire the nation. But others have criticized the notion because it implies a sense of superiority which can fuel racism, warmongering and even idolatry. In this remarkable book, John Wilsey traces the historical development of exceptionalism, including its theological meaning and implications for civil religion. From seventeenth-century Puritans to twentieth-century industrialists, from politicians to educators, exceptionalism does not appear as a monolithic concept to be either totally rejected or devotedly embraced. While it can lead to abuses, it can also point to constructive civil engagement and human flourishing. This book considers historically and theologically what makes the difference. Neither the term nor the idea of American exceptionalism is going away. John Wilsey&#39;s careful history and analysis will therefore prove an important touchstone for discussions of American identity in the decades to come.</p><p>John D. Wilsey (PhD, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary) is assistant professor of history and Christian apologetics at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is the author of <em>One Nation Under God: An Evangelical Critique of Christian America</em>."John Wilsey takes the concept of American exceptionalism&#x2015;a cultural lightning rod if ever there was one&#x2015;and helps us to think deeply about it. Both historian and theologian, Wilsey's larger goal is to help American Christians think historically and Christianly about our national identity. Rather than pushing us either to embrace or reject the view of America as exceptional, he argues persuasively that there are expressions of exceptionalism that the Christian can affirm, as well as aspects that the faithful believer must renounce. His book helps us to discern between the two. Any thinking Christian who aspires to patriotism without idolatry would benefit from reading this fine work." (Robert Tracy McKenzie, professor and chair, department of history, Wheaton College)<br><br>"Distinguished by rich historical details and astute theoretical insights, John Wilsey liberates academic discussions of American exceptionalism and civil religion from their ivory-tower confines and presents them anew to a broad audience. Positioning himself as both an unapologetic American citizen and Christian, Wilsey skillfully describes, defines and critiques these interlocking categories. This book will be of great interest not only to scholars, but also to all people of good will who cherish American diversity alongside the worthy pursuit of establishing a broad and inclusive consensus." (Arthur Remillard, associate professor of religious studies, St. Francis University, author of Southern Civil Religions)<br><br>"This unsparing recitation of manifest destiny, Indian removal, slavery, Cold War dualism and pervasive jingoism should give all American Christians pause. John Wilsey, in offering an alternative model for Christian engagement with the state, moves the conversation toward a higher ideal of global and kingdom citizenship." (David Swartz, assistant professor of history, Asbury Theological Seminary, author of Moral Minority)<br><br>"Nations are what we make them. Inherently, they are neither godly, nor wicked. Most are both. John D. Wilsey demonstrates this and much more. Deeply thought and engagingly written, this book delves into religious claims about American exceptionalism with passion and compassion. Through the twists and turns, Wilsey offers entirely new ways to be faithfully Christian while participating in the life of the nation." (Edward J. Blum, professor of history, San Diego State University)<br><br>"In an age that appears as confused as ever about the connections between the kingdom of Christ and American identity, <em>American Exceptionalism and Civil Religion</em> is vital reading. John Wilsey has charted the complex course of a historical idea, American exceptionalism, in a way that is fair and nuanced, yet honest and timely. Combining far-reaching interaction with the most current scholarship and careful theological reflection, Wilsey tells this story in a way that will be accessible to a broad audience. I am delighted to recommend it widely and enthusiastically!" (Matthew J. Hall, vice president for academic services, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Wilsey provides the most up-to-date history of the concept of American exceptionalism available and shows an astute understanding of its relationship to civil religion. He argues for the adaptation of a pluralistic exceptionalism based on the nation's continuing struggle for and commitment to equality, freedom and justice, rejecting the frequently invoked model that frames America as an innocent nation chosen and commissioned by God." (Anne M. Blankenship, assistant professor, department of history, philosophy and religious studies, North Dakota State University)<br><br>"In his recently released work, <em>American Exceptionalism and Civil Religion</em>, John Wilsey offers a genealogy of thought about god and nation. . . . There is much great food for thought in Wilsey's volume." (Mark Edwards, Religion in American History, November 23, 2015)<br><br>"(Wilsey's) latest book, <em>American Exceptionalism and Civil Religion: Reassessing the History of an Idea</em>, is in many ways a tract for the times. It's historically perceptive, theologically responsible, and hits on a topic that matters to ordinary believers. . . . America is exceptional in many ways, and there is nothing wrong with affirming this conviction. But idolatrous forms of exceptionalism should be rejected as false gospels, even (especially?) when they arise in evangelical contexts otherwise committed to the full authority of the Scripture and transforming power of the good news of Jesus Christ." (Nathan A. Finn, The Gospel Coalition, November 16, 2015)<br><br>"Wilsey should be commended for challenging the hubristic exceptionalism of his intended evangelical audiences while identifying constructive elements for a new patriotism. Certainly, all undergraduate readers will appreciate thinking along with Wilsey about the virtues as well as the vices of nationalism." (Mark Edwards, Journal of Church and State, Summer 2016)<br><br>"The idea that America is exceptional has a long history, but, as calls to 'Make America Great Again' illustrate, its power is far from spent. America's political climate only makes books like John D. Wilsey's all the more important. In a study best described as theologically informed history of an idea, Wilsey surveys American exceptionalism from John Winthrop's 'city on a hill' to Ronald Reagan's 'new patriotism,' weaving together narrative, biographical sketches, exegetical insight, and critical evaluation. The result is a careful, winsome, and constructive treatment of an enduring and important feature of American Christianity. . . . Wilsey should be commended for providing a careful, accessible treatment of such a pertinent topic."

For the millions of fans who grew up during this time, and especially those who cared just as much about Oscar Gamble's afro as they did about his average, this book serves up a delicious, Technicolor trip down memory lane.</p></p><p><p>DAN EPSTEIN has written for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>MOJO</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>USA Today</i>, <i>Time Out</i>, produced shows for VH-1, and is the author of <i>20th Century Pop Culture. </i>He lives in Southern California and is the Managing Editor of shockhound.com, the music website affiliated with the Hot Topic retail chain.</p><p><b>A Q&amp;A with Dan Epstein courtesy of Scratchbomb.com, May 2010</b></p><p>As a kid, I was fascinated by 1970s baseball. The huge afros, the amazing facial hair, the retina-burning uniform designs--it seemed like such an insane, colorful era, particularly when compared to the heavily moussed 80s, where I spent most of my kid-dom. (Of course, there were some colorful characters then, too, but that's a tale for another time.)</p><p>Whenever I had some disposable income (which was not often), I would spend it at a baseball card convention or store, usually on a large plastic box filled with completely worthless cards from 1977 or 1975, just so I could savor such sartorial majesties as Willie McCovey's sideburns. My elementary school library had these slim books on each major league team, all published in the mid-'70s, which I borrowed repeatedly. And whenever my grampa took me to Cooperstown, I'd seek out the unbelievable mini-exhibit on the technicolor uniforms from those years (sadly, no longer there).</p><p>While there are some chronicles of players and teams from the 1970s (<i>T</i><i>he Machine</i> and <i>Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning</i> are great, recent examples), there haven't been many (if any) retrospectives about the decade in total. When people speak of a Golden Age of Baseball, they usually save such mythologizing for the 1950s and its stainless, sepia-tone heroes. </p><p>But now there is finally an evangelist for game as played in the Me Decade. Journalist Dan Epstein has penned a love letter to 1970s baseball entitled <i>Big Hair and Plastic Grass: A Funky Ride through Baseball and America in the Swinging 70s</i>. ESPN's Rob Neyer has said of this tome, "What the 1960s were to America, the 1970s were to baseball, and Dan Epstein has finally given us the swinging book the '70s deserve." The book drops May 25 from Thomas Dunne Books, and there will be a big ol' release party at the Bell House in Brooklyn on May 26 (I for one am excited to try the Oscar Gamble hot dog that will be served there).</p><p>Dan was generous enough to take some time out of his busy schedule and answer some questions via email about Astroturf, day-glo erseys, the best Topps card designs, and the worst promotions of all time. Read all about it after the jump.</p><p><b>What compelled you to write this book?</b></p><p>About ten years ago, I went in search of a good book on '70s baseball; I was born in 1966, so this was the era when I first fell in love with the sport, and I wanted to relive some of those memories, and maybe gain a greater understanding of the period. At the time, the only thing out there that came even close to what I was looking for was Phil Pepe's <i>Talkin' Baseball: An Oral History of Baseball in the 1970s</i>; but while that's a highly enjoyable read (and one I would recommend to anyone interested in the era) I didn't feel like it showed as much appreciation for the funkiness and uniqueness of the era as much as I would have liked--nor have any other of the decade-spanning '70s baseball books that have been published since then. I don't come from a sportswriting background--music and pop culture has been my beat for the past two decades--but I felt that, as a baseball fan, a student of pop culture, and a child of the '70s, I could write a love letter to '70s baseball that also truly celebrated the weirdness of the period. </p><p><b>I have a theory that some of the excesses of 1970s baseball--huge afros, crazy facial hair, drugs, wacky uniform designs, etc.--were the product of the sport desperately trying to catch up after being so resolutely square for so long. Your thoughts?</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>I would have to vehemently disagree--who exactly in the baseball establishment was desperately trying to be hip? Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was as square as they came, and would have been happiest if baseball had resembled a perpetual Norman Rockwell painting; most of the team owners and executives (with the notable exceptions of Bill Veeck and Ted Turner) weren't much hipper. I think the "excesses" you mention were more the result of the freak flag-flying spirit of the late '60s finally worming its way into all elements of mainstream America, baseball included. Think of the JC Penney fashion catalogs from the '70s with all the wacky leisure suits and patterned shirts with giant collars--white, middle-class Americans actually wore that shit without batting an eye, but they wouldn't have even dared to do so ten years earlier. You also had players coming up to the majors who had been college students in the late '60s and early '70s, and thus felt more comfortable engaging the sort of self-expression (ranging from facial hair to outspoken sharing of political beliefs) and drug use that would have been unthinkable in the majors just a decade earlier. And while I do think many of the baseball uniforms of the era were reflective of the more flamboyant trends in '70s male fashion, they were chiefly designed to look impressive on color TV--a device which most American households didn't own until the 1970s.<b></b><br><b></b><br><b>Arguably, the two greatest teams of the 1970s were a study in contrasts: the '72-'74 Oakland A's--a hirsute, hard living, pugnacious bunch--and The Big Red Machine--a mostly strait-laced group that was forbidden to grow long hair or beards. If you had to pick one (not necessarily for purely baseball reasons), which team do you prefer and why?</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Just from a purely aesthetic standpoint, I'm always gonna side with a team of hairy, ornery dudes in gold jerseys and white shoes. But while the Big Red Machine was obviously a force to be reckoned with, the '72-'74 A's were the most well-rounded team of the era. Like the Reds, they had speed and power, but they also had much stronger pitching (Catfish Hunter, Vida Blue, Kenny Holtzman, Rollie Fingers, et al.). And not only did the A's win three straight World Series, but they also won five straight AL West crowns ('71 through '75) and came very close to winning a sixth in '76. Sorry, Joe Morgan--the A's were the one true dynasty of the '70s.<b></b><br><b></b><br><b>Let's say I'm a younger baseball fan unfamiliar with the game in the 1970s. What is the one event/team/player who would clue me in to the awesomeness of this era?</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>God, there are so many to choose from, and for so many different reasons. But I guess Bill Lee or Dock Ellis would be the most obvious choices. Both men were way more outspoken, irreverent, hip and intelligent than your stereotypical major leaguers, both had great taste in music, and they both engaged in some pretty epic battles with the conservative baseball establishment. And, of course, Lee advocated pot use and Ellis pitched a no-hitter on LSD--but they were also incredible competitors who loved the game, and never let their teammates down on the field. If we're going to pick a single event, I'd have to go with the Atlanta Braves' Wet T-Shirt Night in 1977; they just don't do baseball promotions like that anymore!<b></b><br><b></b><br><b>Looking back on it now, which player most exemplifies the 1970s?</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>See above.</p><p><b>Who were your favorite team and player as a kid? Least favorite?</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>In the '70s, I split a lot of time between Los Angeles and Ann Arbor, Michigan, so my two favorite teams were the Dodgers and the Tigers. My favorite Dodger was Ron Cey. I loved that he was known as "The Penguin," and that this oddly-proportioned guy with the funny walk could actually be an All-Star third baseman. I wore #10 on my Little League jersey in his honor. For the Tigers, I loved Willie Horton, Mark Fidrych, Ron LeFlore, etc., but my true favorite was Lou Whitaker. When Sweet Lou came up from the minors, I told all my friends he was going to be a star; and unlike my other grade school baseball predictions (like my brief championing of the Blue Jays' Doug Ault as a sure bet for superstardom), it actually panned out! </p><p>Least favorite team? I hated the Reds, because they were so damn good and always gave the Dodgers a hard time--and I also hated them for sweeping the Yankees (who I liked at the time) in the '76 World Series. Least favorite player would have to be Fred "Chicken" Stanley, at least when he was on the Yankees; he was the weak link in that lineup, and a really mediocre shortstop, and I couldn't understand how he continued to have a job in the majors.</p><p><b>With the disappearance of non-retractable domed stadiums from baseball, Astroturf is all but gone from the game. What players from the 70s would suffer the most if they had to play in this new carpet-free world?</b><br><b></b><br>The players who benefitted the most from artificial turf were the guys who didn't have a lot of power but could make contact with the ball and run like hell, and infielders (especially shortstops) who had good range but not so great arms. Dave Concepcion, Larry Bowa and Freddie Patek all fit the above profiles, and all figured out how to get extra mileage on a throw to first by one-hopping it off the turf. They were all key members of their teams, to be sure; but they also all would've had a tougher go of it playing full-time on real grass.</p><p><b>Worst promotion: Cleveland's Nickel Beer Night or Chicago's Disco Demolition Night?</b><br><b></b><br>Nickel Beer Night--actually, it was Ten Cent Beer Night [<i>D'oh! -- ed.</i>]-- hands down; if not the "worst" promotion, it was certainly the era's most idiotic. Disco Demolition Night was obviously a disaster, but that was largely because the White Sox organization had no real understanding of how popular the "Disco Sucks" movement was in Chicago, or that it would primarily bring rowdy rock fans to Comiskey. But you can't offer your fans unlimited beer at a dime per cup, like the Indians did, and not expect that things will eventually get WAY out of hand; Jesus, even a third grader could tell you that.</p><p><b>Bigger waste of talent: Dave Kingman or Dick Allen?</b></p><p>I don't think it's fair to dub either Kingman or Allen a "waste of talent"--they both enjoyed long careers and put up some impressive numbers along the way. Did Allen's attitude hamper his production during his final few seasons? Possibly, but he was also getting into his mid-30s and dealing with the after-affects of the broken leg he suffered during the 1973 season. And would Kingman hit 442 career homers--would he have hit more if he were less of an asshole? I doubt it. To me, a true waste of talent was someone like David Clyde, the brilliant Texas high school pitcher who the Rangers signed and immediately sent to the big leagues--without necessary minor league training or seasoning -because they knew he would bring the locals out to the ballpark. Clyde couldn't handle the pressure, or the hard-partying lifestyle of the veterans he hung out with, and he was out of the majors for good by the time he was 24. That's just sad.</p><p><b>Best uniform of the 1970s? Worst? (My vote for the latter goes for </b><b>those black and red Indians tops with the inexplicably jagged letters</b><b> or pretty much </b><b>any Padres jersey from the entire decade</b><b>.)</b><br><b></b><br>Hideous as they were, I'm actually really fond of the Houston Astros' "tequila sunrise" jerseys--to me, they beautifully embody both the colorfulness and ridiculousness of the era. But aside from the truly awful 1976 White Sox uniforms with short pants (which the players only wore in a handful of regular season games), my vote for Worst Uni of the 70s goes to the 1978 San Diego Padres. As if the fecal brown and mustard yellow color palette wasn't bad enough, the lettering on the jersey looks like Ray Kroc had 'em thrown together in about five minutes at an iron-on t-shirt store at the local mall. My '78 Little League jersey looked classier than that.</p><p><b>Do you like the recent trend of teams bringing back alternate powder blue jerseys, another 1970s innovation? (Brewers, Royals, Blue Jays)</b></p><p>I do, actually--or at least, I far prefer them to the dark solid "softball" alternates that have been so unfortunately prevalent in recent years. I wish the Phillies would go back to the zip-up powder blues (with the red "P" on the front) that they wore on the road for most of the '70s and into the '80s--I still think those look really sharp.</p><p><b>Best year for Topps baseball card design? (I vote for 1972 or 1975)</b><br><b></b><br>1972, no question. I would describe the design template for that year as psychedelic Hollywood retro; it's as if each player was briefly transported into the "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" sequence from <i>Yellow Submarine</i>. And it made even the scrubs look like superstars.</p><p><b>What are the features you look for in an awesome 1970s baseball card, in terms of design, pose, facial hair, etc.?</b><br><b></b><br>Simply depends on the card. It's hard to beat funky facial hair or a voluminous 'fro, and action shots can be really cool, too. Then again, would a card of Roberto Clemente or Hank Aaron be any more awesome if they'd sported Fu Manchu moustaches? I don't think so.</p><p><b>Dock Ellis's no-hitter-on-acid has gotten a lot of renewed interest, thanks to </b><b>the No Mas animated short</b><b> that came out last year. How prevalent was recreational drug use in baseball in the 70s? What was the drug of choice among players? And had performance enhancing drugs entered the picture yet?</b><br><b></b><br>I don't have anything other than anecdotal evidence to go on, but pot use seems to have been fairly prevalent among major leaguers in the '70s. Coke much less so, though (like in the rest of America), it became more common by the end of the decade. As far as performance-enhancing drugs, it's not inconceivable that steroids had entered the picture by then--they've been around since the '30s, and there's evidence that football players were using them as early as the late '60s--but they were hardly widespread. Back in those days, weight training and getting buff wasn't a regular part of the major league baseball fitness regimen; the prevailing wisdom of the time was that you should run a lot, and that lifting weights would make you too "muscle-bound" to be effective in the field. Use of amphetamines, however, was extremely common; I'm sure a lot of players wouldn't have made it through a 162-game season without them--though whether or not "greenie" use actually improved anyone's play or jacked up anyone's numbers in the long run is still pretty debatable.</p><p><b>Is there a game or playoff series from the 1970s that you consider a "lost classic"--something that should still be remembered now but isn't?</b></p><p>Well, it's not been completely forgotten, but the June 28, 1976 game between the Yankees and Tigers is pretty dear to my heart. That was the night that Mark "The Bird" Fidrych made his national TV debut, beating the Yankees 5-1 on Monday Night Baseball in front of an ecstatic Tiger Stadium crowd. He's so goofy on the mound, yet also so dominant--and during the post-game int...</p><b>Big Hair and Plastic Grass</b><br><b>CHAPTER 1</b><b>1970</b>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>After a year marked by the <i>Apollo 11</i> moon landing, the Stonewall riots, the Tate-LaBianca murders, the music festival yin/yang of Woodstock and Altamont, and the intensified U.S. bombing of Vietnam, the odds of 1970 being placid and turbulence-free were practically nonexistent. 1969 had witnessed multiple seismic shifts in American culture and consciousness--so many indications that daily reality was growing ever more distant from the idealized Norman Rockwell/<i>Leave It to Beaver</i> picture of life in these United States--and sizable aftershocks were all but guaranteed. "I feel alright," growled Iggy Pop on the Stooges' new single, "1970," but hardly anyone else did--which is partially why record buyers rejected the Stooges' apocalyptic celebration in favor of reassuringly palliative 45s from Simon &amp; Garfunkel ("Bridge Over Troubled Water"), the Beatles ("Let It Be"), and Ray Stevens ("Everything Is Beautiful").Sports had long been a refuge for Americans yearning for the nostalgic, comforting glow of simpler times, but now tremors were occurring in that world, too. "Broadway Joe" Namath, a playboy and raconteur who also happened to play quarterback for the New York Jets, had recently shocked the nation by correctly predicting a Super Bowl victory by his upstart AFL squad over the heavily favored Baltimore Colts of the NFL. Ninemonths after Namath's career-defining Nostradamus moment, the even less-respected New York Mets--a team that had only been in existence since 1962, and had never finished better than ninth in a 10-team league--capped a miraculous 100-win season with a five-game World Series takedown of the mighty Baltimore Orioles. It didn't take an apoplectic Baltimore sports fan or a busted Vegas oddsmaker to sense that change was in the air.Anyone paying attention to baseball during 1969 should have recognized that a new era in the sport was rapidly emerging. Four teams joined the majors that year--the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots in the American League, and the San Diego Padres and Montreal Expos in the National League. Not only was major league baseball being played for the first time outside the confines of the 50 states, but both leagues were also now split into Eastern and Western divisions, with a new best-of-five playoff to determine which division winners would represent their league in the World Series.There were changes happening on the field, as well. Concerned that the low-scoring games which characterized the 1968 season--a.k.a. "the Year of the Pitcher," when only six batters in the major leagues hit .300 or better--were alienating the average baseball fan, commissioner Bowie Kuhn mandated that the regulation height of major league pitcher's mounds should be reduced to 10 inches (down from 15-plus), and that umpires should tighten their strike zones. The adjustments resulted in instant offense: Overall scoring for both leagues increased by an average of nearly a run and a half per game. But these changes, though significant, were nothing compared to what 1970 would bring ... .&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For Kuhn, the first sign that the coming year would be a challenging one arrived on Christmas Eve 1969, in the form of a letter from St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood. Two months earlier, Flood--a Gold Glove, three-time All-Star center fielder who had been a mainstay of three pennant-winning Cards teams--received word that he'd been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies as part of a seven-man deal that also sent Cardscatcher Tim McCarver to Philadelphia, and brought controversial Phils slugger Dick Allen to St. Louis. And now, in a direct challenge to baseball's reserve clause, Flood was refusing to go to the Phillies.A relic of the late 19th century, the reserve clause had been invented to keep players from jumping to a new team whenever someone offered more money. Under the reserve clause, a player who signed with a particular ballclub was essentially the property of said ballclub in perpetuity, and could be traded or released at the whim of management. Come contract time, a player could conceivably "hold out" for more money; but if the club refused to meet his salary demands, the player's only options were to sign for whatever pittance the team deemed appropriate, or retire from baseball. Besides a painful lack of leverage in salary negotiations, players under the reserve clause had no say regarding where or when a team might trade them; the "no-trade" and "limited-trade" clauses of today's contracts didn't exist.An intelligent and dignified man, Flood felt the reserve clause was simply a tool for baseball ownership to keep salaries down and control their players--allowing them, in his tart words, "to play God over other people's lives." After twelve seasons and three World Series with the Cardinals, Flood believed he had the right to be treated better than well-fed livestock, and his letter asked Kuhn to declare him a free agent.The Major League Baseball Players Association had already attempted several times to get the owners to modify the reserve clause, without any success--so no one was particularly surprised when Kuhn denied Flood's initial request. But on January 16, 1970, Flood shocked the baseball world by filing a $4.1 million civil lawsuit against the commissioner and Major League Baseball; the suit challenged the reserve clause, contending that the rule violated federal antitrust laws.Though Flood was black, and he certainly caused a stir by likening the reserve clause to slavery, he maintained that <i>Flood v. Kuhn</i> had less to do with the Black Power movement of the day than with trying to get rid of an antiquated and inequitable aspect of the game. "I'd be lying if I told you that as a black man in baseball I hadn't gone through worse times than my teammates," he told the Players Association. "I'll also say, yes, I think thechange in black consciousness in recent years has made me more sensitive to injustice in every area of my life. But I want you to know that what I'm doing here I'm doing as a ballplayer, a major league ballplayer."Still, many in the media painted Flood as a militant agitator, a baseball counterpart of Stokely Carmichael and the Black Panthers. In the early '70s, any pairing of the words "black" and "militant" was virtually guaranteed to raise the hackles of white America; unsurprisingly, much of the hate mail that Flood received during the case was racial in nature. Some writers painted a picture of Flood as a greedy, self-centered ballplayer (the fact that Flood was already making $90,000 a year won him little sympathy from fans), or as the unwitting dupe of union negotiator and Players Association executive director Marvin Miller.In reality, Miller had painstakingly prepared Flood for the disastrous effect that the lawsuit could have upon his career. In order to show that he was serious about the cause, Flood would have to sit out the 1970 season while the case went to court; even if he won the case, Miller told him, it was extremely likely that he would be blackballed from the game for having the temerity to challenge the lords of baseball. Though the Players Association was helping to bankroll Flood's lawsuit, the players themselves were queasy about publicly (or even privately) expressing their support for Flood, because of the damage it might cause their own careers. Once the trial opened in May in New York District Court, Hall of Famers Jackie Robinson and Hank Greenberg (as well as former Indians/ Browns/White Sox owner Bill Veeck) testified on Flood's behalf, but the witness stand would be noticeably devoid of Flood's former teammates or current players.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Compounding Kuhn's Flood lawsuit headache, the February 23 issue of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> broke a story entitled "Baseball's Big Scandal--Denny McLain and the Mob," which revealed that the Detroit Tigers ace (who'd just won the AL Cy Young Award two seasons running) was deeply enmeshed with a Flint, Michigan, bookmaking operation with ties to organized crime. Most damning was the article's allegation that the mysteriousfoot injury McLain suffered late in the 1967 season--which caused him to miss six starts, and probably cost the Tigers a pennant--had actually been mob payback for welshing on a bet.Baseball's public image had been relatively spotless since the 1919 "Black Sox" incident--indeed, since the formation of the baseball commissioner's office itself--and a gambling scandal was about the last thing Kuhn wanted, much less on only the second year of his watch. After grilling McLain, the commissioner announced that he was suspending the pitcher indefinitely while launching a full-scale investigation into the matter.For all his pitching heroics (most notably a 31-win, 280-K, 1.96-ERA performance in 1968), McLain was anything but a sympathetic figure. A self-proclaimed racist and male chauvinist, McLain was prone to shooting his mouth off at the slightest provocation--a quality that made him a favorite of Detroit sports reporters, but which continually aggravated Tigers management and his teammates. He also seemed willing to do just about anything for money (during the off-season, he had a regular gig at the Riviera Hotel in Vegas, playing a Hammond X-77 organ and telling corny jokes), but had a hard time hanging on to any of it; a month after his suspension began, the IRS raided his home in Detroit and took all his furniture to pay off an outstanding tax debt. The idea that McLain might be involved in an illegal gambling operation hardly seemed far-fetched--and, as investigators eventually concluded, it wasn't.Following the investigation, McLain received a three-month suspension from the commissioner's office, effective April 1. Kuhn took pains to stress that McLain had not wagered on baseball or...</p><h2>John Muir: The Eight Wilderness Discovery Books</h2><p><br><br>* Muir is perhaps the nation's greatest conservationist<br><br>* His books reveal why he devoted his life to preserving the West's greatest natural treasures<br>The name John Muir (1838-1914) has come to stand for the protection of wilderness both in the United States and abroad.

Of course, in Canada where theMMI was developed, it continues to be the interview format of choice at mostschools. It was clear to me that we needed a detailed resource to helpapplicants prepare for the MMI.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Was there anything else thatmotivated you to write this book?</b><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I have received a number ofemails from applicants/parents across the country, expressing concern about theMMI.

In some cases, applicantshad only a single MMI interview, and everything hinged on their MMIperformance. Sadly, things didn't work out, and that bothered me because Ireally felt that these applicants had the potential to make some important contributionsto our profession.

We address some of this in the book.<br><br><b></b><br><b>What else would you like totell applicants?</b><br><br>If you've received aninterview, I would like to congratulate you. With the intense competition forspots, it's an honor to receive an interview invitation. Now with thisinvitation in hand, there's still a lot of work to be done. Although the MMI ischallenging, it's not insurmountable, and you can do well.

Friedman: My Rules</h2><p>The definitive monograph of Glen E. Friedman, a pioneer of skate, punk, and hip-hop photography, including much never-before-published work. Glen E. Friedman is best known for his work capturing and promoting rebellion in his portraits of artists such as Fugazi, Black Flag, Ice-T, Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, The Misfits, Bad Brains, Beastie Boys, Run-D.M.C., and Public Enemy, as well as classic skateboarding originators such as Tony Alva, Jay Adams, Alan "Ollie" Gelfand, Duane Peters, and Stacy Peralta, and a very young Tony Hawk. Designed in association with celebrated street and graphic artist Shepard Fairey, this monograph captures the most important and influential underground heroes of skateboarding, punk, and hip-hop cultures. My Rules is an unprecedented window into the three most significant countercultures of the last quarter of the twentieth century, and Friedman&#x2019;s photographs define those important movements that he helped shape. A remarkable chronicle and a primer about the origins of radical street cultures, My Rules is also a statement of artistic inspiration for those influenced by these countercultures.</p><p>Glen E. Friedman&#x2019;s work has appeared in countless publications and exhibitions and is part of permanent collections, including those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., among others. Shepard Fairey is a graphic designer. C. R. Stecyk III is the founder of Juxtapoz magazine. Henry Rollins is a musician and writer. Chuck D is a rap artist and activist. Tony Alva is a world-renowned skateboarder. Ian Mackaye is a musician and record label owner. Rick Rubin is an award-winning record producer. Adam Horovitz is a musician."Glen E.

Many photos of skaters mid-stride and bands mid-riff could not have been taken otherwise. Whether skate, punk, or hip-hop, Friedman photographed those who rebelled against the society that did not accept them in the first place. That some of them went on to influence popular culture and made it to the top of that very same society still seems somewhat strange. Whether Friedman is right or wrong is up for debate.

Interspersed between the clusters of images are recollections from some of Friedman&#x2019;s collaborators and subjects, including rapper Chuck D of Public Enemy, former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins, and the artist Shepard Fairey, who collaborated on the design of the book with Friedman.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Artinfo</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br> "Glen E.

We meet the first of five richly-textured, complex generations of unforgettable characters. The separate lives of these driven men and independent women are drawn to a common destiny that beckons seductively from the wild and remote flanks of the American West.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Book Two, <i>Maps of Fate,</i> they are swept into the dangerous currents of the far-distant frontier by the mysterious rivers of fate, the power of the land and the American spirit. Secret maps, hidden ambitions, and magnetic attractions inherent in lives forged by the fires of love and loss, hope and sorrow, life and death, shape their futures and the destinies of their lineage.<br> <br> In Book Three, <i>Uncompahgre,</i> the men and women of the saga having reached their initial destination: pre-Denver, Cherry Creek, are each faced with life altering decisions. Some must decide to pursue or abandon torrid love affairs that have flowered on the dangerous journey from Europe and across America. An aristocratic vaquero chased North by the Texas Rangers catapults into the tale. The next generation of Threads West characters will soon be born in the wilderness.&nbsp; The elderly slave couple, Oglala Sioux family, and renegade -- and his young, traumatized captive introduced in <i>Maps of Fate</i>--are bound ever more tightly to the arc of the tale -- their tragedy and triumph-filled tales weaving into the cloth of a collective destiny.<br> <br> In <i>Moccasin Tracks</i>, Book Four, the brave, passion-filled characters of <i>Uncompahgre</i> struggle in this unknown wilderness, racing against an early, foreboding winter to establish their homestead, some preoccupied with serious pre-birth complications of the next generation of <i>Threads West </i>characters, other's compelled by an inner sense to blaze a separate trail, but all united to fend off ever-present dangers. The different personalities of their surviving offspring begin to manifest, some in disturbing ways. The Sioux family, bewildered by the increasing attack on their culture is swept unknowingly into the tumultuous vortex of momentous changes shaping the United States and the West as the tidal wave of white man's greed and intolerance inundates their ancestral territory.&nbsp; Land, love, gold, tradition and the burden of family responsibility shape these characters of divergent origin as they love and struggle in the beautifully vibrant but unforgiving landscape of the West. The personal conflicts inherent to these characters of uncommon cultures and competing ambitions are exacerbated by a nation in transition, the precipice of Civil War, and both deep bonds and lethal enmities with Native Americans. <br> <br> <br> <b>You will recognize the characters who live in these pages.

Mo lives with his family in Massachusetts.</p>PreSchool-K&#x2014;Cat the Cat visits her friends, asking them to make their sounds. The dog woofs, the chick peeps, the cow moos, but the bunny is silent. As Bunny the Bunny makes no response, the others look at him with sympathy and say in unison, "sounds like...somebody needs a hug!" On the one hand, the message seems to be that even if you are different, your friends still love you. On the other hand, an underlying message is that if you are different, your friends will feel sorry for you. Not quite the same as celebrating the differences. The illustrations are characteristically spare with flat, unshaded colors outlined in black. Repeated use of a pale green background on each spread ties the whole book together nicely. Using few words, Willems relies on facial expressions and body posturing to convey humor with minimal detail. Making the animal sounds concept more interesting is a secondary story line: the animals are all preparing for a tea party. Cat the Cat gaily carries a basket covered with a checked napkin as she visits each animal who in turn is preparing something to share at the party. Willems does <i>almost</i> everything right. Children will enjoy making animal sounds and will laugh at his silly humor. But the underlying message that differences may elicit pity is an unfortunate flaw that keeps this book from being a winner.&#x2014;<i>Mary Hazelton, Elementary Schools in Warren &amp; Waldoboro, ME</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

Vernadsky, the great Russian-Ukrainian biogeochemist. It was first published in 1930 in French in the <i>Revue g�n�rale des sciences pures et appliqu�es</i>. In it, Vernadsky makes a powerful and provocative argument for the need to develop what he calls &#x201c;a new physics,&#x201d; something he felt was clearly necessitated by the implications of the groundbreaking work of Louis Pasteur among few others, but also something that was required to free science from the long-lasting effects of the work of Isaac Newton, most notably. </p> <p>For hundreds of years, science had developed in a direction which became increasingly detached from the breakthroughs made in the study of life and the natural sciences, detached even from human life itself, and committed reductionists and small-minded scientists were resolved to the fact that ultimately all would be reduced to &#x201c;the old physics.&#x201d; The scientific revolution of Einstein was a step in the right direction, but here Vernadsky insists that there is more progress to be made. He makes a bold call for a new physics, taking into account, and fundamentally based upon, the striking anomalies of life and human life.</p> <p>Published by 21st Century Science &amp; Technology</p></p><p></p><h2>The Pursuit of HappinessGod&#39;s Way-Living the Beatitudes</h2><p>When we think of happiness, we have to admit that our idea is at times worldly and self-centered. Jesus in His Sermon on the Mount showed us that true happiness will elude us, however, if we follow that kind of thinking. And, in the form of a series of promises and challenges, which we have come to know as the Beatitudes, He told us how to find perfect happiness--both here and in the hereafter. In a world that is capable of the best and the worst, we all have reason to be concerned about the very possibility of ever finding happiness in our lifetimes. The good news of the Gospel message is that we can. Even more, it teaches a way based not on rules and obligations so much as one founded on love, a way that depends upon and leads to the blessings of God Himself. These pages have been written in the conviction that every seeker should make the Sermon on the Mount the primary source of what will and will not make her happy. In His approach to the question, Jesus insists from the outset that we face up to the inevitable trials of life: poverty, tears, hunger and thirst, and shows us how we can find God--the source and object of our joy--in the midst of them.</p><p>Servais Pinckaers, OP, is presently professor of moral theology at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.

Former veterinary technician and animal advocate Tracey Stewart understands this better than most&#x2014;and she&#x2019;s on a mission to change how we interact with animals. Through hundreds of charming illustrations, a few homemade projects, and her humorous, knowledgeable voice, Stewart provides insight into the secret lives of animals and the kindest ways to live with and alongside them. At home, she shows readers how to speak &#x201c;dog-ese&#x201d; and &#x201c;cat-ese&#x201d; and how to &#x201c;virtually adopt&#x201d; an animal. In the backyard, we learn about building bee houses, dealing nicely with pesky moles, and creative ways to bird-watch. And on the farm, Stewart teaches us what we can do to help all farm animals lead a better life (and reveals pigs&#x2019; superpowers!). Part practical guide, part memoir of her life with animals, and part testament to the power of giving back, <i>Do Unto Animals</i> is a gift for animal lovers of all stripes.</p><p>Tracey Stewart is the editor-in-chief of the website Moomah, which provides parents and kids with fun, easy, and effective ways to contribute to varying kinds of nonprofits.&nbsp;A passionate animal advocate and expert (she&#x2019;s a former veterinary technician), she lives on a farm in New Jersey with her husband, Jon Stewart; two kids; four dogs; two pigs; one hamster; three rabbits; two guinea pigs; one parrot; and two fish&#x2014;all rescues except for the kids.&#x201c;<i>Do Unto Animals</i>&nbsp;is delightful, entertaining, and hugely important. Tracey&#x2019;s love for animals has led to a profound understanding of their world, and it becomes clear that the better we know this world, the better their lives will be. And this, in turn, will make our own lives more fulfilling. It is the perfect gift for all who love animals. And for those who should love them better.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Jane Goodall, PhD, DBE, founder of the Jane Goodall Institute, and UN Messenger of Peace</b><br><br> &#x201c;Charming. . . .

A lifelong animal lover and one-time veterinary technician, Stewart evinces a genuine empathy for all creatures, from the lowliest frog to the loftiest owl, and winsomely guides other animal enthusiasts in their desire to develop a more rewarding relationship with man&#x2019;s best friend, whatever that turns out to be. An ardent proponent for the adoption of rescue animals, Stewart broadens that philosophy to include sanctuaries for farm animals as well. Married to former host of <i>The Daily Show</i>, Jon Stewart, who announced their plan to create just such a haven for at-risk animals, Stewart is on a mission far above the typical, nominal celebrity cause du jour. Rich in informed insights on animal behavior, augmented by creative craft projects, and alluring with clever watercolor illustrations, Stewart&#x2019;s passionate and practical guide to living with domestic pets, backyard critters, and farm animals artfully combines sensible advice with grassroots advocacy. Stewart&#x2019;s zeal for animal welfare is infectious and sincere, and her desire to create a kinder world for animals and humans is earnest and essential.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;<b>Booklist</b></i><b>, starred review</b><br><br> &#x201c;A one-of-a-kind mix of info, advice, philosophy and hands-on activities.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i><b>Philadelphia Daily News</b></i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Gives readers not only facts and advice, but also smart and caring ways to improve animals&#x2019; existences.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<i><b>Chicago Tribune</b></i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;With humor and grace, this beautiful and inspiring book helps us to understand and appreciate animals and encourages us to treat them with compassion and respect . . .&nbsp;How we treat other animals is a reflection of who we are, and this wonderful book helps us to be kinder, better people.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Gene Baur, co-founder and president, Farm Sanctuary</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This book is a dazzling confluence of art, heart, and animal welfare information.

Here, books are a passion (<i>there is no problem a library card can't solve</i>) and TV is something other people watch. Their father-a professor of Shakespeare who speaks almost exclusively in verse-named them after the Bard's heroines. It's a lot to live up to.</p><p>The sisters have a hard time communicating with their parents and their lovers, but especially with one another. What can the shy homebody eldest sister, the fast-living middle child, and the bohemian youngest sibling have in common? Only that none has found life to be what was expected; and now, faced with their parents' frailty and their own personal disappointments, not even a book can solve what ails them...</p></p><p><p></p><strong>Alex George, author of <i>A Good American</i>, interviews <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author Eleanor Brown about <i>The Weird Sisters</i></strong>.<p></p> <p><strong>Alex George:</strong> <i>The Weird Sisters</i> is centered on three adult sisters who move back to their childhood home, and the ways they react to this reintroduction to the family fold. You have moved about quite a lot during your adult life; did writing about going home have particular significance for you?</p> <p><strong>Eleanor Brown:</strong> While I believe very much in the idea of blooming where you are planted, I also think there are certain places where we feel more comfortable, more &#x201c;at home,&#x201d; and I have definitely spent time seeking that. I&#x2019;ve loved different things about all the places where I&#x2019;ve lived, but they haven&#x2019;t all been healthy or happy places for me. And that&#x2019;s what the sisters in the story struggle with--what they want or think they want isn&#x2019;t always the right thing for them, and where they live is part of that.</p> <p><strong>George:</strong> As the daughters of a Shakespearean professor, the sisters are named after characters from the Bard&#x2019;s plays. You had a host of possibilities to choose from--I&#x2019;m curious about how, and why, you settled on Rosalind, Bianca, and Cordelia.</p> <p><strong> Brown:</strong> I&#x2019;m fascinated by the influences that contribute to making us who we are, and <i>The Weird Sisters</i> is deeply concerned with two of those: birth order and naming. I firmly believe that I would be a different person if my parents had given me a different name, just as the sisters in the book would be different if I had named them after other Shakespearean heroines.</p> I chose these specific names because the Shakespearean characters had specific traits I wanted to bring out in my characters. That&#x2019;s the advantage of being an author instead of a parent--knowing how people are going to turn out before you name them!<p></p> <p><strong>George:</strong> The girls&#x2019; father is a gloriously eccentric professor, and the family members frequently resort to quoting lines from Shakespeare rather than expressing themselves in their own words. How did you find exactly the right quotation for each situation? And did you ever steer the characters&#x2019; conversation a certain way in order to incorporate a particular Shakespearean quotation?</p> <p><strong> Brown:</strong> Using Shakespearean quotations started as a way to imitate how families develop their own languages--nicknames, punch lines--and ended up expanding into a meditation on how families communicate, and how difficult it is to change patterns once they are set.</p> <p>I did a great deal of research before and while I was writing the book, including rereading and re-watching a number of the plays, and keeping notes of particularly delicious lines. But I realized as I wrote that I couldn&#x2019;t bend a scene just to use a line, so I would often go running back to my <i>Complete Works</i> or a Shakespeare concordance to find something appropriate. The family has such encyclopedic knowledge of Shakespeare&#x2019;s works that they&#x2019;re forever taking things completely out of context, which just contributes to the confusion over what they are trying to say. Take it from me, quoting Shakespeare when things get emotionally difficult is not a great way to communicate.</p> <p><strong>George:</strong> One of the many things I loved about <i>The Weird Sisters</i> is how, while the story is set firmly in the town of Barnwell, it is impossible to date it precisely. Why did you do that? In your mind, do you know when the story is set?</p> <p><strong>Brown:</strong> There were two main reasons for leaving the book slightly unmoored in time. The first was that the Andreas family is unusual. They are a family of readers (and they&#x2019;re more likely to read Shakespeare than the latest blockbuster novel) in a small college town in the summer, when things feel dreamlike and time moves differently. I wanted them to be &#x201c;in the world, but not of it,&#x201d; so leaving things indefinite felt appropriate.</p> <p>The second is that as a reader, I worry that too many references to brand names, or celebrities, or technology, or politics, can make a book stale before its time, and I didn&#x2019;t want that to happen with <i>The Weird Sisters</i>. If you read very closely and do some math, you can come up with a span of about a decade when the book could be set, but that doesn&#x2019;t have a great influence on the story.</p> <p><strong>George</strong> Final question, and it&#x2019;s fantasy time. You can put your novel into the hands of any one person in the world, in the knowledge that this person will read it. Whom do you choose, and why?</p> <p><strong>Brown:</strong> Writing <i>The Weird Sisters</i> was my way of figuring out the answers to questions that were troubling me: for instance, why, despite all my grown-up responsibilities, I didn&#x2019;t feel like an adult; why family roles are so fixed; why, no matter what I achieved, I felt like a failure, like I was always falling behind everyone else. One of the great miracles of having this story published is the number of people of all ages who have said to me, &#x201c;I feel the exact same way.&#x201d;</p> <p>Since giving it to myself would cause all kinds of disruptions in the space-time continuum, I suppose I&#x2019;d like to give it to someone else who is struggling with some of those same questions, as a way of telling that person, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>(Photo of Alex George � Carole Patterson)</p> <p>(Photo of Eleanor Brown � Joe Henson)</p>Eleanor Brown&#39;s writing has been published in anthologies, magazines, and journals.

It's Mrs. Quack the Duck, who is dreadfully upset after having narrowly escaped some hunters and their terrible guns. Worst of all, she has lost Mr. Quack, her husband, and doesn't know whether he is alive or dead. Peter, Jerry Muskrat, and the other animals in the Green Forest vow to help Mrs. Quack find a safe place to live and to try and locate Mr. Quack.

Burgess (1874&#x2013;1965) wrote thousands of animal stories for children, starting with the 1910 publication of <i>Old Mother West Wind.</i> Burgess's tales convey his fascination with wildlife and his concern for nature, teaching gentle lessons about ecology and respect for the environment.</p><h2>Six Drawing Lessons (The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures)</h2><p><p>Over the last three decades, the visual artist William Kentridge has garnered international acclaim for his work across media including drawing, film, sculpture, printmaking, and theater. Rendered in stark contrasts of black and white, his images reflect his native South Africa and, like endlessly suggestive shadows, point to something more elemental as well. Based on the 2012 Charles Eliot Norton Lectures, <i>Six Drawing Lessons </i>is the most comprehensive collection available of Kentridge&#x2019;s thoughts on art, art-making, and the studio.</p><p>Art, Kentridge says, is its own form of knowledge. It does not simply supplement the real world, and it cannot be purely understood in the rational terms of traditional academic disciplines. The studio is the crucial location for the creation of meaning: the place where linear thinking is abandoned and the material processes of the eye, the hand, the charcoal and paper become themselves the guides of creativity. Drawing has the potential to educate us about the most complex issues of our time. This is the real meaning of &#x201c;drawing lessons.&#x201d;</p><p>Incorporating elements of graphic design and ranging freely from discussions of Plato&#x2019;s cave to the Enlightenment&#x2019;s role in colonial oppression to the depiction of animals in art, <i>Six Drawing Lessons </i>is an illustration in print of its own thesis of how art creates knowledge. Foregrounding the very processes by which we see, Kentridge makes us more aware of the mechanisms&#x2015;and deceptions&#x2015;through which we construct meaning in the world.</p></p><p>William Kentridge is an artist who lives and works in Johannesburg.&#x201c;[This] is an enlightening, circuitous, and self-reflexive performance that delves into [<b>Kentridge</b>&#x2019;s] greatest obsessions in the realms of art, politics, history, and image-making... Kentridge discusses topics including Plato&#x2019;s cave allegory (a subject that looms over much, if not all, of the book), Africa&#x2019;s colonies, and the violence of the Enlightenment. He delivers sharp insights into the history and character of Johannesburg; his memories from growing up under apartheid provide some of the book&#x2019;s most lucid moments. He also elaborates upon life in the art studio (a &#x2018;safe space for stupidity&#x2019;)...Time&#x2015;including how it affects work in the studio&#x2015;and memory are also major themes. The argument here is really an anti-argument; Kentridge emphasizes the need to occupy the gap between certainty and uncertainty, and stresses &#x2018;being aware of the limits of seeing,&#x2019; and &#x2018;our own limits of understanding, the limits of our memory, but prodding the memory nonetheless.&#x2019;...This is an essential book for anybody seeking a better understanding of Kentridge&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Anyone who has seen the film animations of the great South African artist will be fascinated by the account he gives of his thinking and studio practice.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kenneth Baker</b><b>, </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a beautiful and necessary book in all respects...It looks at the work of an artist from his own perspective, which in some instances may be a risky strategy, but <b>Kentridge</b> is such a good writer that the book is as brisk as it is insightful...He is also a wonderful draftsman, and his drawings, often executed in pen and ink or cut paper, are carefully reproduced here. The production of this book was handled as a work of art too. The size, proportion, binding, and attention to detail are superb.

After studying law in London, he championed Indian rights in South Africa for two decades. He returned to India in 1914, leading a campaign of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience against British rule. Philip Wilkinson&#39;s lively narrative takes us through his remarkable life, up to India&#39;s independence in 1947, and the tragic conclusion; in 1948 Gandhi was assassinated by a fanatic opposed to his program of tolerance for all creeds and religions.</p><p><b>Philip Wilkinson</b> has written nearly 50 books for adults and children. They range from his first book, <i>Amazing Buildings</i>, which won an award from the American Institute of Architects, to <i>A Celebration of Customs and Rituals of the World</i>, which was endorsed by the United Nations. He has also written several successful TV tie-ins, including <i>What the Romans Did for Us</i> and <i>Restoration</i>. Wilkinson lives in the Cotswolds, England, with his wife and son.Gr. 4-7. A well-rounded selection of archival photographs and other images illustrate this title in the World History Biographies series. Double-page spreads describe phases in Gandhi's life, from childhood to his tragic death, detailed in Wilkinson's straightforward, succinct language and in anecdotes, which will capture young people's attention and also humanize the great leader: as a young lawyer, for example, Gandhi was too shy to speak in courtrooms. Some spreads offer background on related subjects, such as the roots of Indian-British confrontations. Maps and photographs of Indian locations and a time line (running in a banner along the bottom of most pages) give further context, and a bibliography and a glossary conclude. A fine starting place for reports about Gandhi and Indian history, this book is also concise and lively enough to inspire young people's personal interest. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Commemorated, evoked, and mythologized as it has been-chiseled and engraved onto countless monuments, the subject of an endless stream of books and films-its triumphant outcome was by no means predetermined. In December 1940, months after war was declared, the director of plans at the War Office in London was asked to draft a paper on how to win the war. He replied that he could only plan "for not losing."<br><br><em>Britain's War: Into Battle, 1937-1941 </em>is the first of two volumes in which Daniel Todman offers a brilliantly fresh retelling, an epic history to fit an epic story. "Opening with his discovery of some war medals sitting in a hearing-aid box that likely belonged to his grandfather, Todman realizes that despite it all a new generation seems unaware of what was truly at stake when Churchill invoked Britain's "finest hour." The war was far greater than any single heroic hour. For six years, Britain was at the dark heart of history, finding its way forward hour by hour, day by day, year by year. This volume spans the beginning and the end of the beginning, from the massive changes required to get the country onto a war footing, through the failure of appeasement, the invasion of Poland, the "phony war," the fall of France, the "miracle" of Dunkirk, the Battles of Britain, and the Blitz, ending with America's course-changing entrance into the conflict in late 1941. <br><br>Todman's colossal project seamlessly merges economic, strategic, social, cultural, and military history in one compelling narrative. Rapid industrialization, social disruption, food rationing, Westminster politics, class snobbery, and the mobilization of a global empire are woven together with the major opening battles. Here, also, are key individuals-the politicians, industrialists, pub owners, housewives, the pilots of the RAF, and the sailors at Dunkirk-caught in the maelstrom that threatened to engulf not just a small island nation but the world itself.<br></p><p><br><strong>Daniel Todman</strong> is Senior Lecturer in the School of History at Queen Mary University of London. He is the co-editor of Field Marshall Lord Alanbrooke's <em>War Diaries, 1939 - 1945.</em><br><br>"Todman has established a high bar for himself with this excellent first sortie into the conflict's history." -- Alan Allport, <em>Journal of Modern History</em><p></p><br>"A decade ago, Daniel Todman made his mark with a decidedly revisionist book on World War I, <em>The Great War: Myth and Memory.</em> In his second major work of popular history, <em>Britain's War: Into Battle, 1937-1941</em> he aims to modify our perceptions of the United Kingdom's role in World War II. In this, the first of two planned volumes, he succeeds triumphantly." - Wall Street Journal<p></p><br>"Todman's book seems deserving of high respect for the amount he has read, the fluency of his narrative, mastery of complex information and generally clear and shrewd judgments. The author brings to a new audience a mass of ideas and data familiar only to my own aging generation. This is an energetic, ambitious, provocative work by a young historian of notable gifts, which deserves a wide readership." - Max Hastings, author of <em>The Secret War</em> <br><p></p><br>"In the opening pages of this book, the first volume in a monumental new history of Britain's experience of the 'long' Second World War, Daniel Todman presents his own personal links to the world of the war through which his grandparents lived. This could have been a rather sentimental journey, but Todman tells their story with a light touch. As Todman demonstrates, one of the most remarkable aspects of Britain's war effort was the strong sense that the country would not be defeated and would, in the end, emerge victorious. EL The voices in Todman's book provide endearing evidence of such certitude and endeavour." - Richard Overy, author of <em>A History of War in 100 Battles</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Britain's War</em> is a sharply focused account of the transition of government and people from peacetime routines to the practices of total war. Hugely if overwhelmingly informative, the book brings us up to date with accuracy and precision across a multitude of fields." - <em>The Times Literary</em> <em>Supplement</em><p></p><br>"<em>Into Battle,</em> the first volume of Dan Todman's new history of Britain and the Second World War, is a tour de force. Taking the story up to the end of 1941, Todman provides us with a judicious guide to the road to war and its catastrophic first phase, offering in addition a shrewd portrait of Churchill which is worth the price of the book alone. Total history at its best." --Jay Winter, Yale University<p></p><br></p><h2>Baseball&#39;s Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy</h2><p>In this gripping account of one of the most important steps in the history of American desegregation, Jules Tygiel tells the story of Jackie Robinson's crossing of baseball's color line. Examining the social and historical context of Robinson's introduction into white organized baseball, both on and off the field, Tygiel also tells the often neglected stories of other African-American players--such as Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella, Willie Mays, and Hank Aaron--who helped transform our national pastime into an integrated game. Drawing on dozens of interviews with players and front office executives, contemporary newspaper accounts, and personal papers, Tygiel provides the most telling and insightful account of Jackie Robinson's influence on American baseball and society.

It was first published in the Latin version of Postellus in 1552. It exists in numerous Greek MSS., the best of which is said to be one of the tenth century. The Syriac versions are older, and, with occasional abbreviations, agree fairly with the Greek text, and with one another. The fragment translated by Dr. Wright is supposed to belong to the sixth century; the text on the palimpsest of Mrs. Lewis is referred to the fifth or sixth century. The Gospel in its present form can hardly (notwithstanding Tischendorf) be put earlier than the third century; but the older form lying behind it certainly goes back to the second century. Coincidences are noted between the Gospel and Justin Martyr (A.D. 150) which, in the opinion of good scholars, point to its use by that apologist (cp. Sanday on The Gospels in the Second Century). Origen refers to the Book of James in proof that Joseph had sons by a former wife (in Matt. tom. x. 17); and the connection with the Protevangelium is not disproved by the fact that elsewhere he gives a different account of the death of Zacharias (in Matt. Tract. 25). The contents of the Gospel show it to have been partly based on the narratives of the Nativity in Matthew and Luke. That in its present form it is composite seems evident from chap. xviii., which is put in the first person into the mouth of Joseph, and is extravagant in its style of description. On the ground of this chapter one is tempted to suspect an origin in Essenian-Ebionitic circles. Either in its present or in an earlier shape it formed the basis of the writing afterwards to be mentioned&#x2014;the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, and through it of the later Nativity of Mary. A prominent motive of the composer is obviously to exalt the virginity of Mary.

This latest book presents his discourses on life beyond the physical world. He reveals how our loved ones remain connected to us and may be communicated with. He helps us understand dreams of death, dying, and dreams in which the dead appear or communicate. He explains the nature of our mind, its multilevels, and how it may venture beyond physical consciousness even while we are incarnate. Of course, Cayce also presents his insights into reincarnation and how we souls travel together through many lifetimes, even with our pets. He explains how life is truly continuous, how the mind and soul never die. From his perspective, it is not a death but only a transition to the other side and many realms of activity and learning all leading to a realization of our ultimate purpose for existence.</p><p>Edgar Cayce was born in 1877 and lived until 1945. For more than forty years of his life, he gave what are called psychic readings. As a young man, he discovered that he had an unusual ability to put himself into an altered state of consciousness. He seemed to have access to virtually all knowledge. He was called the sleeping prophet&#34; and is the most documented psychic of our time. The book There is a River documents this fascinating man s life and has sold more than one million copies.</p><h2>Beyond Bop Drumming: Book &amp; CD (Manhattan Music Publications)</h2><p>Beyond Bop Drumming is John Riley&#39;s exciting follow-up to the critically acclaimed Art of Bop Drumming.

Sleuth and scholar Marixa Lasso recounts how the canal&#x2019;s American builders displaced 40,000 residents and erased entire towns in the guise of bringing modernity to the tropics.</b></p><p>The Panama Canal set a new course for the modern development of Central America. Cutting a convenient path from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans, it hastened the currents of trade and migration that were already reshaping the Western hemisphere. Yet the waterway was built at considerable cost to a way of life that had characterized the region for centuries. In <i>Erased</i>, Marixa Lasso recovers the history of the Panamanian cities and towns that once formed the backbone of the republic.</p><p>Drawing on vast and previously untapped archival sources and personal recollections, Lasso describes the canal&#x2019;s displacement of peasants, homeowners, and shop owners, and chronicles the destruction of a centuries-old commercial culture and environment. On completion of the canal, the United States engineered a tropical idyll to replace the lost cities and towns&#x2015;a space miraculously cleansed of poverty, unemployment, and people&#x2015;which served as a convenient backdrop to the manicured suburbs built exclusively for Americans. By restoring the sounds, sights, and stories of a world wiped clean by U.S. commerce and political ambition, Lasso compellingly pushes back against a triumphalist narrative that erases the contribution of Latin America to its own history.</p></p><p>Marixa Lasso teaches history at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Prior to that she was a tenured Associate Professor at Case Western Reserve University. She received grants from the American Council of Learned Societies and the National Humanities Center to support her research on this book. She has also held fellowships from the Social Science Research Council, the Fulbright Foundation, and the Wenner Gren Foundation. In 2016 Lasso was the Sheila Biddle Ford Fellow at Harvard&#x2019;s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. Her work has been translated into Spanish and Portuguese.&#x201c;<i>Erased</i> is the most splendid of ghost stories. Tracing the hidden history of the depopulated &#x2018;lost towns&#x2019; of the Canal Zone, Marixa Lasso reveals a traumatic transformation of the landscape as important in its impact as the construction of the Panama Canal. The result is a powerful and dramatic tale of lost histories that illuminates our understanding of Panama and its relationship to the United States.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Julie Greene, University of Maryland</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Erased</i> shows how the construction of the Panama Canal hid forced depopulation behind the artificial transformation of the landscape, building segregated urban centers on the myth of a pristine tropical landscape. The book challenges narratives of industrialization and urban change that have for too long neglected the history and the places of the people who built the basic infrastructure of modernity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Pablo Piccato, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Commandeering rafts, steamboats, or railroads, countless isthmian black settlers for centuries had brought the Caribbean and the South Sea together. In the 1910s, the Canal Zone turned these modern black urbanites into unwelcome refugees. Their towns disappeared under water or tropical vegetation. The Canal also wiped out the memory of vibrant black republican institutions, the foundational vanguard of global political modernity. This book expertly dissects the myth of Western Civilization, namely, how a unified capitalist world became two imaginary ones: an entrepreneurial, law-abiding, technically advanced white Canal Zone, on the one hand, and a violent, <i>pardo</i>, primitive tropical banana republic, on the other. Eye-opening.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jorge Ca�izares-Esguerra, University of Texas at Austin</b><br><br>&#x201c;Stimulating...<i>Erased</i> is in effect a justification of Latin America in the face of northern cultural and economic domination.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andreas Campomar</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Spectator</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;More than a history of how the U.S. reduced Panama&#x2019;s most populous and developed stretch of territory to tropical wilderness.

These years shaped the emergence of what Natalia Molina describes as an <i>immigration regime</i><i>,</i> which defined the racial categories that continue to influence perceptions in the United States about Mexican Americans, race, and ethnicity.<br> <br> Molina demonstrates that despite the multiplicity of influences that help shape our concept of race, common themes prevail. Examining legal, political, social, and cultural sources related to immigration, she advances the theory that our understanding of race is socially constructed in relational ways&#x2015;that is, in correspondence to other groups. Molina introduces and explains her central theory, <i>racial scripts</i><i>,</i> which highlights the ways in which the lives of racialized groups are linked across time and space and thereby affect one another. <i>How Race Is Made in America </i>also shows that these racial scripts are easily adopted and adapted <i>t</i>o apply to different racial groups.</p><p>"Molina provides a fresh, sophisticated analysis of the powerful racial 'scripts' generated in twentieth-century US political and legal culture, and of the Mexican population's unique vulnerability in the 1920s and after as eminently 'deportable.'

It was as if the black wood of the bedposts were meant to root us Walker women to this place of flat fields and fertile soil carved from the great Mississippi. But like the levees built to control the mighty river, it never held us for long.</p><p>We were born screaming into this world, the beginning of a lifelong quest to find what would quiet us. Our legacy was our ability to coax living things from fallow ground, along with a desperate need to see what lay beyond the delta. A need to quell a hurt whose source was as unexplainable as its force.</p><p>Whatever it was that drove us away was never stronger than the pull of what brought us back. Maybe it was the feel of the dark Mississippi mud or the memory of the old house and the black bed into which we&#x2019;d been born, but no matter how far we ran, we always came back.</p><p>I returned in the spring nearly nine years to the day after I&#x2019;d left. I&#x2019;d driven straight through from Los Angeles, twenty-seven hours of asphalt and fast food, my memories like a string guiding me home. The last leg from Little Rock to Indian Mound was punctuated by bright flashes of lightning and constant tornado watches on the radio. I kept my foot pressed to the accelerator as strong winds buffeted my car. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me to stop. I had a trunk&#x2019;s worth of hurts piled in the car with me that only my grandmother Bootsie could make go away. She would forgive those long years of silence because she understood doggedness. I&#x2019;d inherited it from her side of the family, after all.</p><p>It was nearly dawn when the storm passed and I crossed the river into Mississippi and headed east on Highway 82 and into the heart of the delta. The hills and bluffs to the west disappeared as if a giant boot had flattened all the land between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers, creating a landscape as rich and fertile as it was difficult to contain and control. This place of my ancestors was known to make or break a man, and I figured by now the scorecard was about even.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;ve been a long time gone.</i> Billboards and highway lights fell away, leaving behind empty fields and ramshackle structures swallowed by kudzu, turning them into hulking ghosts haunting the roadside. Sinewy cypress swamps randomly appeared as if to remind us of our tenuous hold on the land. The predawn flatscape flashed by me in shades of gray, as if the years had absorbed all the color, so that even my memories were seen only in black and white.</p><p>A therapist had once told me that my hindsight color blindness was due to an unhappy childhood. I tried to tell him that I had never considered my motherless childhood to be <i>unhappy.</i> It was more of an accumulation of years filled with absence, that perhaps black and white were simply the colors of grief.</p><p>The rising sun had painted the sky pink by the time I passed the sign for Indian Mound, the first seeds of panic making my heart beat faster. I glanced over at my purse, where I kept my pills, wondering whether I could swallow them dry again as I&#x2019;d been doing for most of the trip. My throat felt sore, and my hands shook. <i>I&#x2019;m almost home</i>. I turned my gaze toward the dim light outside that seemed to swallow my car as I passed through it, and pressed my foot harder on the accelerator.</p><p>I slowed down, trying to avoid the increasing amount of debris tossed across the road, the tree limbs, leaves, and roof shingles that seemed to have been scattered by the hand of a careless child. I caught up to an old, faded red pickup truck as it slowed down at the bright flashing red and blue lights of a police car stopped in front of fallen electrical lines. A large, brindled dog, his lineage as indecipherable as the vintage of the pickup truck in which he sat, stared at me with a lost expression. A police officer guided our way around the danger zone, his other hand reminding us to slow down. As soon as he had disappeared from my rearview mirror, I sped up, passing the truck and maneuvering past a mailbox that stood upright in the middle of the highway as if it were meant to be there.</p><p>My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth and I thought of the pills again, and how easily they could take away the pit of worry that had begun to gnaw at me. I went faster, clipping a tree limb with my left front tire and hearing a crack and a thump of the split wood hitting metal. I kept going, realizing that I was prepared to drive on the rim of a flat tire if I had to. <i>I&#x2019;ve been a long time gone.</i></p><p>I turned off the highway onto a dirt road studded with puddles and rocks. The road bisected a large cotton field, the furrows drowning in standing water. I remembered this road and had turned by instinct. It probably had a name, one we&#x2019;d never used when giving directions to the odd visitor. We usually instructed visitors to turn right about one and a half miles past the old general store, which leaned to the left and still had a Royal Crown Cola sign plastered over the doorway even though it had been abandoned long before I was born.</p><p>The store was gone now, but I still knew where to turn in the same way my hair still knew where to part no matter how hard I tried to tell it different. But the road was the same, still narrow, with the tall white oaks&#x2014;taller now, I supposed&#x2014;creating a green archway above. Tommy and I used to race barefoot down this road, watching our feet churn up dust like conjured spirits.</p><p>My back tires spun out, bringing me back to the present and slipping my car off the side of the road. Panicking, I gunned the engine, succeeding only in digging the wheels further in muck. Although I knew it was useless, I gunned the engine two more times. I stared through the windshield down the tree-shaded road. It had taken me nine years to come back. I figured stretching it out for a few more minutes wouldn&#x2019;t matter.</p><p>I began to walk, my leather flats sticking to the Mississippi mud as if reluctant to let me go again. A murder of crows sprang up out of the trees, cawing loudly and making my heart hammer as I tried counting them, recalling the nursery rhyme Mathilda had sung to me as a child.</p><p>One for sorrow,</p><p>two for mirth,</p><p>three for a wedding,</p><p>four for a birth,</p><p>five for silver,</p><p>six for gold,</p><p>seven for a secret never to be told,</p><p>eight for heaven,</p><p>nine for hell,</p><p>And ten for the devil&#x2019;s own self.</p><p>I clenched my teeth, wishing I&#x2019;d taken another pill. I glanced over my shoulder at the car, realizing too late that I&#x2019;d left my purse. I&#x2019;d almost decided to go back when a flurry of wings made me look up. Seven black crows, their inky black wings seeming wet in the light of the sun, swirled and dipped over me, cawing and cackling, then took off again across the field.</p><p>My throat stung as I walked faster, feeling light-headed as I tried to recall the last time I&#x2019;d eaten. And then the trees by the side of the road fell away and I stopped in a large clearing with a wide, paved drive edged with centuries-old oak trees. The old yellow house of indeterminate architecture with columns and porches and an improbable turret and at least three different roof styles stood before me in all of its confused splendor. It was an anomaly among all the Greek Revival homes of the region, as peculiar and original as the women who&#x2019;d lived there for two centuries. My heart slowed as if Bootsie were already with me, letting my head rest on her shoulder. I had come home.</p><p>Despite the storm, the house appeared almost untouched except for the litter of pink azalea petals that had been stripped from their stems and scattered around the drive and yard like fuchsia doubloons from a Mardi Gras float.</p><p>Grass blades stuck their tips out of standing water in the yard as if struggling for breath, the water reflecting the sky and odd yellow house. Its windows stared down on me with reproach, as if wondering at the audacity of the return of another Walker woman, my hubris in believing it wanted me back. But I&#x2019;d lived my first eighteen years inside its walls and had run through the fields of cotton that surrounded it. This house was the only spot of color in my monochromatic memories.</p><p>I listened for the songbirds, as much a part of my memory as the landscape. Except for the crows, the only sound cutting the silence was that of dripping water as it fell to the ground from the eaves and chipped paint of the old house, and from the arthritic fingers of the oak trees. I slowly walked up the wooden steps to the wide porch, pausing to take off my mud-caked shoes and leave them by the side of the door, just as I had done as a child. I placed my hand on the large brass knob of the front door before deciding to knock instead.</p><p>I knocked twice, waiting for the tread of my grandmother Bootsie&#x2019;s footsteps, or the glide of my mother&#x2019;s bare feet. Or even the heavier tread of my older brother, Tommy. But all I heard was the sound of the water leaking from the house. <i>Drip. Drip.</i></p><p>I hesitated for a moment, then reached for the knob. It didn&#x2019;t turn. In all of my years growing up, the front door had never been locked. I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder if they&#x2019;d known I was coming after all. I stood for a moment with my hands on my hips until I remembered it was a stance my mother had frequently used, and dropped them again. The air was heavy with the scent of rain and the boxwoods that had begun to creep over the porch railings unchecked.</p><p>I slid my shoes back on and crossed the drive to walk around the side toward the old carriage house that had been converted into a garage sometime in the twenties. I recognized Bootsie&#x2019;s 1977 white Cadillac convertible and my heart lurched with relief. A white pickup truck with an enormous toolbox in the bed that I assumed was Tommy&#x2019;s sat behind it, and next to it was a dark sedan that looked suspiciously like an unmarked police car. I didn&#x2019;t take the time to think about why it was there. I walked quickly now, no longer caring about avoiding puddles, needing to be embraced by my grandmother until I no longer craved my pills to soothe away the hurting.</p><p>I moved to the backyard, looking toward the rear of our property, toward the forest full of sweet gums and pines, the solid land giving way to the swamp and giant bald cypress trees that Tommy had once told me were over a thousand years old. A lone cypress tree had managed to take root on higher ground halfway between the house and the swamp, standing by itself among the sparse grass and haphazard pine trees whose scraggly branches always made them look bewildered next to the corded majesty of the giant cypress. I&#x2019;d called it &#x201c;my tree&#x201d; as a child, and I longed to sit in the comforting shade of its branches again.</p><p>But the landscape had been altered. Limbs and leaves mixed blindly with papers and other indistinguishable man-made debris. A porch swing that I remembered had once hung on the front porch sat right side up, its chains missing, in the middle of the yard. Close by, almost as if they&#x2019;d been set there on purpose, were the two metal chairs that had always graced my grandmother&#x2019;s vegetable garden. They had once been a neon lime color, but sun and time had faded them into a disappointed green. With the swing, they formed a cohesive seating group, almost as if the wind had decided in the middle of its destruction to take a break.</p><p>I paused, feeling my equilibrium shift as if I&#x2019;d just stepped off a moving sidewalk. I took in the three figures standing in the near distance, and then waited for my gaze to register what they were standing next to, blinking twice until I understood. My tree, the stalwart reminder of the best parts of my childhood, had toppled over, clipping the edge of the old cotton shed. The roots were singed black, with chunks of bark encircling the area. I imagined I could smell the burnt ions in the air from the lightning strike, still feel the atmosphere pulsating with the power of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Bootsie?&#x201d; I called out, my walk becoming a run. Three heads turned in my direction just as another cluster of crows flew out from the dead tree, their shiny black bodies seeming to mock me.</p><p>I stopped in front of the small group, my breath coming in gasps, as we regarded one another, all of us looking as if we&#x2019;d just seen a ghost. Nobody said anything as my gaze moved from one person to another, registering my brother&#x2019;s face, and then another man, and then my mother. Whereas Tommy wore jeans and an untucked shirt, like he&#x2019;d just been roused from bed by the sound of a lightning strike, my mother wore a silk brocade cocktail dress taken directly from the Kennedy White House, complete with rhinestone earrings and matching bracelet and ring. I recalled seeing a photograph of her mother, Bootsie, wearing the same ensemble.</p><p>My mother turned to me with mild surprise. &#x201c;Vivien, I know I&#x2019;ve told you before that you should never leave the house without lipstick.&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at her for a long moment, wondering if there was more to this altered landscape than just a fallen tree.</p><p>My brother hesitated for a moment, then took a step forward to embrace me. He was ten years older than me, and almost a decade had passed since I&#x2019;d last seen him, but now, at nearly thirty-seven, he still looked like the gangly and awkward boy I&#x2019;d grown up with. Tommy&#x2019;s shirt was soft and worn under my fingers, and I clutched at the familiarity of it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t smile.</p><p>My lips trembled as I tried to smirk at his vast understatement, as if we both believed his words could erase nearly nine years of silence. &#x201c;Hello, Tommy.&#x201d; I forced a deep breath into my lungs. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Bootsie?&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes softened, and I knew then that I&#x2019;d lost more than just time in the last nine years. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been gone awhile.&#x201d; His gaze drifted to our mother in her cocktail dress and high heels and something icy cold gripped the area around my heart.</p><p>Before I could say anything, the other man stepped forward. Tripp Montgomery was as tall and slender as I remembered him, short brown hair and hazel eyes that always seemed to see more of the world than the rest of us. He wore khaki pants and a long-sleeved shirt and a tie, which only added to my confusion. I looked at him, wondering why he was there and hoping that somebody would tell me this was all a dream and that I&#x2019;d soon awaken in my bed in the old house with Bootsie kissing my forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Tripp said, as if he&#x2019;d just delivered me to my front steps after school. As if the earth had somehow stopped spinning in this corner of the world and everything was the same as when I&#x2019;d left it. Except it wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; I asked, plucking at one of the random questions I needed to ask to make the ground beneath my feet stand still.</p><p>His face remained impassive, but I thought I saw a flicker of what looked like sympathy pass through his eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the county coroner.&#x201d; He stepped back, allowing my gaze to register the gaping hole in the ground that the intricate root system of the giant cypress had once inhabited. The grass around the edges...</p></p><h2>The Silver Mask (Magisterium #4) (4)</h2><p>A generation ago, Constantine Madden came close to achieving what no magician had ever achieved: the ability to bring back the dead. He didn't succeed . . . but he did find a way to keep himself alive, inside a young child named Callum Hunt.<br><br> Now Call is one of the most feared and reviled students in the history of the Magisterium, thought to be responsible for a devastating death and an ever-present threat of war. As a result, Call has been imprisoned and interrogated. Everyone wants to know what Constantine was up to-and how he lives on.<br><br> But Call has no idea.<br><br> It is only when he's broken out of prison that the full potential of Constantine's plan is suddenly in his hands . . . and he must decide what to do with his power.<br><br> In this spellbinding fourth book of Magisterium, bestselling authors Holly Black and Cassandra Clare take us beyond the realm of the living and into the dangers of the dead.</p><p>Holly Black is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of The Spiderwick Chronicles (with Tony DiTerlizzi) and the Newbery Honor&#x2013;winning novel <i>Doll Bones</i>. Her other books include The Good Neighbors graphic novels, and the novels <i>The Darkest Part of the Forest</i>, <i>Tithe</i>, <i>Valiant</i>, and <i>Ironside</i>. She currently lives in the realm of Western Massachusetts.<br><br> Cassandra Clare is the author of <i>City of Bones</i>, the first book in The Mortal Instruments trilogy and a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. Her latest series, The Infernal Devices, has spawned three #1 bestsellers. Born overseas, Cassandra spent her early years traveling around the world with her family and several trunks of books. She lives in Massachusetts.Gr 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Callum, known as "Call," has spent six months in the Panopticon, bored by a lack of visitors and stressed out over the constant interrogations about his identity as Constantine Madden, a likeness he doesn't relate to or want. With his secret exposed and others afraid of him, he is surprised by assistance from an unlikely source, and finds his own trust violated by a demand to do the impossible in return for his freedom. Call's guilt over Aaron's death as well as the possibility that Constantine's powers could fall into the wrong hands move him to action, but the horror of success leads to devastation. What does it mean to be a hero, and is Call up to the challenge when he has lost so much already? Black and Clare bring the intensity of this series to an all-time high, with an emotional turn of events involving the dignity of life, the nature of a soul, and the value of true friendship. The budding romance between Call and Tamara feels a little out of place under the circumstances, as readers might expect the two of them to focus on their predicament rather than sharing kisses, but the inevitability and chemistry of their relationship is undeniable. VERDICT A must-purchase for libraries that carry this series; devotees will be thrilled to get their hands on this installment, which ends on a chilling cliff-hanger.

To those familiar with the work of Bruce K. Waltke, the significance and value of Genesis will be instantly apparent. Others who are unfamiliar with Waltke have only to read the first few chapters to understand why he has earned the reputation of a scholar&#x2019;s scholar, and why this masterful volume stands like a monolith among Old Testament commentaries.Exploring the first book of the Bible as "theological literature," Waltke illuminates its meanings and methods for the pastor, scholar, teacher, student, and Bible-lover. Genesis strikes an unusual balance by emphasizing the theology of the Scripture text while also paying particular attention to the flow and development of the plot and literary techniques--inclusion, irony, chiasm, and concentric patterning--that shape the message of the "book of beginnings".GenesisModels the way to read and interpret the narratives of the book of GenesisProvides helpful exegetical notes that address key issues and debates surrounding the textIncludes theological reflections on how the message addresses our contemporary theological and social issues, such as ecology, homosexuality, temperance, evil, prayer, and obedienceAddresses critical interpretive issues, such as authenticity, date, and authorshipFor all the author&#x2019;s formidable intellect and meticulous research, Genesis is amazingly accessible. This is no mere study tool. Lucidly and eloquently written, it is a work of the heart that helps us not only to understand deeply God&#x2019;s Word in its context, but also to consider how it applies to us today.</p><p>Bruce K.

The subtle change from "the heavens and the earth" (1:1) to "the earth and the heavens" (2:4b) may point to the shift in perspective. The account of the heavens and the earth records the drastic change from the pristine "very good" creation to the harsh realities now experienced outside the temple-garden. Through the Fall, sin and death enter the human race and the earth becomes cursed. Both humanity and the earth are in need of redemption. In the historical event of the Fall, Adam and Eve function as archetypes for humanity&#x2019;s disobedience. The priestly guardians of the sanctuary are tested for their fidelity to their King. Obedience entitles them to life with God (cf. Deut. 30:15&#x2013;20). Failure points to their need for justification and sanctification through the covenant of redemption established with and through Jesus Christ. OUTLINE OF BOOK 1 Superscription 2:4a Act 1: Humanity on probation 2:4b&#x2013;25 Scene 1: Man on probation, 2:4b&#x2013;17 Scene 2: Gift of the bride, 2:18&#x2013;23 Epilogue, 2:24&#x2013;25 Act 2: The Fall and its consequences 3:1&#x2013;24 Scene 1: The Fall, 3:1&#x2013;7 Scene 2: The shape of judgment, 3:8&#x2013;19 Epilogue, 3:20&#x2013;24 Act 3: Escalation of sin in the line of Cain 4:1&#x2013;24 Scene 1: Cain and Abel, 4:1&#x2013;16 Scene 2: Lamech, 4:17&#x2013;24 Epilogue (Transition to Book 2) 4:25&#x2013;26 LITERARY ANALYSIS OF BOOK 1 Genre Like the creation account, the account of the heavens and the earth has historical solidity. The story is based on events in time and space, a real Adam and Eve. But it is not merely a historical account. The style is artistic and figurative rather than scientific and literalistic. The scenes of creation are painted as an artist might envision them: God, as a potter, forming the man; as a gardener, designing a garden of beauty and abundance; and as a temple builder, raising the woman from the rib of the man. The suprahistorical dimension is also essential for the theology of this account. On this register, Adam and Eve represent every man and woman (Gen. 3:16&#x2013;19; cf. 2:24; Matt. 19:4&#x2013;6; Rom. 5:12).4 They represent our own rebellion, fallenness, and need for God&#x2019;s graceful redemption. This is as important as the historical dimension. Therefore, both the historical and the suprahistorical should be held in proper tension. Structure and Plot In contrast to the static and balanced report of creation in the prologue, the account of the heavens and the earth unfolds like a drama with all the elements of scenic depiction, contrast, conflict, and climax. This is a drama of three acts opening with paradise, falling to despair, and resolving with a seed of hope. Each act opens with a setting and concludes with a poem (which captures the theme of the act), followed by an epilogue (cf. 2:23 with 24&#x2013;25; 3:14&#x2013;19 with 20&#x2013;24; 4:23&#x2013;24 with 25&#x2013;26). The first act begins with Adam in a paradisiacal garden separated from the rest of creation. The garden is a temple, and its priest is the man with the woman to help him. Scene 1 features vegetation, which has a prominent role in the probation. Scene 2 presents the animals, which are important to the "gift of the bride." The poem concluding this act celebrates God&#x2019;s gift of a wife. The second act begins with the crafty serpent. Against the backdrop of the same lush and holy garden, humanity forfeits its priestly role. Plants and animals together have important roles in this moment of decision for the protagonists. The act concludes with a poem of judgment and salvation. The third act begins outside the garden with the woman giving birth. The setting outside of the paradisiacal garden conveys humanity&#x2019;s failure, but Eve&#x2019;s childbirth conveys God&#x2019;s grace and the hope that remains. The concluding poem of this act, Lamech&#x2019;s song of revenge, forcefully depicts humanity&#x2019;s escalating sin and violence. The first two acts are closely related by a chiasm: A Creation of man: his happy relationship with the earth and his home in the garden, where he has freely growing food and access to the tree of life (2:4&#x2013;17)<p>B Creation of woman: her happy relationship with man (2:18&#x2013;25)</p><p>C Conversation of serpent with woman: his tempting of her (3:1&#x2013;5)</p><p>X The sin and God&#x2019;s uncovering of it (3:6&#x2013;13)</p><p>C&#x2019; Punishment of serpent: its spoiled relationship with woman (3:14&#x2013;15)</p><p>B&#x2019; Punishment of woman: her spoiled relationship with man (3:16) A&#x2019; Punishment of man: his spoiled relationship with the earth and expulsion from his home in the garden; he now has to toil to secure food and will no longer have access to the tree of life (3:17&#x2013;24). This analysis exposes the crucial moment as Adam and Eve&#x2019;s choice to eat the forbidden fruit. The chiasm may justify combining acts 1 and 2 into one act: "the expulsion of man from the Garden." Escalation The acts display humanity&#x2019;s worsening situation. The serpent tempts Adam and Eve to sin, but Cain sins after God encourages him to do what is right. Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit, but Cain murders his brother, fears being killed and his offspring repeatedly kill in unbridled revenge and debase God&#x2019;s ideal for marriage by polygamy. Not surprisingly, Cain&#x2019;s punishment is more severe than Adam&#x2019;s. According to Dorsey, "Adam is...</p><p>� driven from the garden, to settle in a new home east of Eden</p><p>� forced to till the soil to get food</p><p>� separated from the source of perpetual life (the tree of life),while Cain is...</p><p>� driven out, doomed to wander forever with no permanent home</p><p>� not even able to till the soil for his food</p><p>� hounded by death (would-be killers) wherever he goes."</p></p><h2>Changed Through His Grace</h2><p>&#34;Have you been changed by grace?&#34; In this insightful book, Brad Wilcox explores this life-altering question in depth. Christians throughout the centuries have used grace to describe God&#39;s favor, goodwill, and love. However, grace is more than a description of God&#39;s attributes. It is the help, power, and strength He offers as we choose to engage with Him in striving to attain those attributes. Grace is different from the Atonement. It is not Christ&#39;s suffering, death, and resurrection. Rather, grace is the power that flows from those sacred moments. Grace is not a priesthood ordinance, but essential ordinances invite greater and greater endowments of grace into our lives. Grace is a divine gift, but like a gift, it must be received. In this book, Brother Wilcox uses real-life stories and personal experience to demonstrate how we can choose to receive Christ&#39;s grace more fully throughout the entire perfecting process of life.</p><p>Brad Wilcox is an associate professor in the Department of Ancient Scripture at Brigham Young University where he also enjoys teaching at Campus Education Week and Especially for Youth. He also loves presenting at Time Out for Women events across the country. He is the author of The Continuous Atonement, The Continuous Conversion, and The 7-Day Christian, and the BYU devotional, &#34;His Grace is Sufficient.&#34; As a young man, Brad served his mission in Chile and later returned to that country to preside over the Chile Santiago East Mission from 2003 to 2006.

How can you learn to think well? What does it mean to love God with your mind? Can the intellectual life be a legitimate <em>Christian</em> calling? Is the intellectual life your calling? James Sire brings wit and wisdom to bear on these questions and their possible answers. And he offers an unusual "insider's view" of learning how to think well for the glory of God and for the sake of his kingdom. In <em>Habits of the Mind</em> Sire challenges you to avoid one of the greatest pitfalls of intellectual life--by resisting the temptation to separate being from knowing. He shows you how to cultivate intellectual virtues and disciplines--habits of mind--that will strengthen you in pursuit of your calling. And he offers assurance that intellectual life can be a true calling for Christians: because Jesus was the smartest man who ever lived, Sire argues, you can and should accept the challenge to think as well as you are able.</p><p>James W. Sire (PhD, University of Missouri), formerly a senior editor at InterVarsity Press, is an active speaker and writer. He has taught English, philosophy, theology, and short courses at many universities and seminaries. He continues to be a frequent guest lecturer in the United States and Europe. His InterVarsity Press books and Bible studies include <em>The Universe Next Door</em> (a worldviews textbook), <em>Scripture Twisting, Discipleship of the Mind, Chris Chrisman Goes to College, Why Should Anyone Believe Anything at All?, Habits of the Mind, Naming the Elephant, Learning to Pray Through the Psalms, Why Good Arguments Often Fail </em> and <em>A Little Primer on Humble Apologetics.</em>Sire shoots down the theory that to be a Christian and an intellectual is oxymoronic. What does it mean to be an intellectual? he asks. What does it mean to think well and responsibly? He examines how to cultivate intellectual virtues and disciplines in the ongoing pursuit of knowledge. He defines what an intellectual is--one who is in love with ideas is the short explanation--and ultimately challenges Christians to accept the responsibility to "think well." An intellectual, he notes, must be fairly intelligent, have access to a good education, and be able to communicate effectively. A Christian intellectual is all that and, in addition, directs every act and every thought to the glory of God. More than that, Christian intellectuals must do as they say--hypocrisy is not an option--and must act on what they claim to know to be the truth. The qualities of an intellectual mind include a passion for truth, a passion for holiness, and constancy, patience, and perseverance. <i>June Sawyers</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But what does God say about gossip? In Resisting Gossip, Pastor Matt Mitchell not only outlines the scriptural warnings against gossip, but also demonstrates how the truth of the gospel can deliver believers from this temptation.</p><p>Pastor of Lanse Evangelical Free Church in Lanse, PA, since 1998, Mitchell received his Doctor of Ministry degree from Westminster Theological Seminary in Biblical Counseling under the leadership of the faculty of the Christian Counseling and Educational Foundation (CCEF).With clarity and the precision of a spiritual physician, Matt cuts deep into the cancerous disease that produces words that hurt and defame. Not only will this book help you keep your tongue in check, but it will also be a helpful navigational tool in guiding your speech toward the joyful discipline of using words to help and heal others to the glory of God! Put the principles of this book into practice, and you, your family, friends and colleagues will all be better off! --Dr. Joseph M. Stowell, president of Cornerstone University, Grand Rapids, Michigan<br><br>Gossip is a spark that starts countless relational fires every day. Matt provides practical, biblical guidance on how believers can reduce this insidious problem by bringing their tongues under the lordship of Christ. --Ken Sande, president of Relational Wisdom 360, Billings, Montana<br><br>In Resisting Gossip experienced pastor Matt Mitchell skillfully tackles one of the most overlooked and destructive sins within the church. Dr. Mitchell s wise, biblical approach carefully defines gossip (no one excluded here!) and gets to the heart of both the causes and cures of this problem. Full of scriptural insight, practical examples and thoughtful questions for group discussion, this one-of-a-kind book aims to do nothing less than transform the way we speak to and about one another. Whether you are a perpetrator of gossip or a victim of gossip (invariably both!), you will surely find tangible help and Christ-centered hope in its pages. --Michael R.

She&#x2019;d been the town&#x2019;s librarian from the time I&#x2019;d first moved to our town, fond of greeting me with lines such as &#x201c;What will it be, Jessica&#x2014;more books on poisons?&#x201d; She retired a few years ago when her multiple sclerosis finally grew too bad for her to continue negotiating the stacks.</p><p>In lieu of a eulogy, Jean had penned brief snippets directed at any number of town staples. I thought mine would take the cake, until Sheriff Mort Metzger&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201c;Well, Mort, I guess I&#x2019;m going to get away with not paying those parking tickets, after all&#x201d;&#x2014;got a louder laugh.</p><p>Meanwhile, the snippet for Seth Hazlitt, Cabot Cove&#x2019;s resident family doctor, raised merely a collective giggle:</p><p>&#x201c;I think you can cancel my next appointment, Seth.&#x201d; But then &#x201c;Sorry, but I don&#x2019;t have a forwarding address to send my bill&#x201d; got a louder reception.</p><p>I hate funerals, but then again, I don&#x2019;t know anyone who likes them. Jean&#x2019;s was different in the sense that she&#x2019;d beaten the odds at every turn: first by outlasting the dreaded disease&#x2019;s debilitating effects and then by drastically outliving her expected life span. She&#x2019;d even enjoyed a final renaissance of sorts, thanks to an experimental new treatment provided by the Clifton Clinic, aka Clifton Care Partners, a state-of-the-art private hospital that had opened just outside town and was about to celebrate its first anniversary. Billed as a &#x201c;rejuvenation&#x201d; clinic as well as a hospital, the Clifton Clinic had drawn a steady flow of outsiders to our once bucolic town year-round, further roiling those of us who remembered what it had been like when we could greet everyone in Cabot Cove by name.</p><p>I learned a long time ago that you can&#x2019;t fight change; even the beloved home I&#x2019;d shared with my late husband, Frank, was undergoing extensive renovations in the wake of a fire that had nearly claimed my life. Funerals always make me think of Frank, which, I suppose, is why I&#x2019;ve come to detest them so much. Frank and I practically raised our nephew Grady, which meant he grew up witnessing my fits and starts of writing back in my days substitute teaching high school English. It had been Grady who&#x2019;d plucked my first manuscript, The Corpse Danced at Midnight, almost literally from the trash and given it to his girlfriend at the time, who happened to work for Coventry House, the imprint that would ultimately become my first publishing house.</p><p>And if it weren&#x2019;t for him, I&#x2019;d probably still be filling in for others instead of filling in the plot holes I inevitably found through my rewrite process.</p><p>Listening to the priest wax on with more of Jean O&#x2019;Neil&#x2019;s testimonials left me feeling I should invite Grady and his family up for a visit soon. It had been too long since I&#x2019;d seen them, especially young Frank, named after my husband, and more like a grandson to me, given that his namesake and I had raised his father through a great measure of Grady&#x2019;s youth. And he so enjoyed blaming some of the business scrapes he&#x2019;d gotten himself into over the years pursuing this scheme or that one on having a fertile imagination to match mine.</p><p>Thinking of Grady and his family also made me realize it had been too long since I&#x2019;d spoken with George Sutherland, the Scotland Yard inspector who was the only man I&#x2019;d ever actually dated since Frank&#x2019;s death, though I&#x2019;m not sure our get-togethers were dates so much as two friends enjoying some mutual interests and each other&#x2019;s company.</p><p>In other words, dates.</p><p>Since Jean had no family, the Friends of the Library had taken on the task of arranging her service and funeral arrangements, and passed on a wake or memorial in favor of a reception to follow her burial in Cabot Cove&#x2019;s local cemetery, which was part of the National Historic Register. As chair of the Friends, I had the official greeting responsibilities, which I was dutifully performing outside the church when I spotted Mimi Van Dorn approaching.</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful service, Jessica,&#x201d; she said, taking my hand affectionately. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it would&#x2019;ve made Jean proud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Mimi. I sure do miss her.&#x201d;</p><p>Mimi looked around the front of our old church, shaking the platinum blond hair from her face. Once her natural color, it now came courtesy of a bottle. Mimi was several years older than I, but you wouldn&#x2019;t know that from her appearance. She joined the Friends of the Library as soon as she moved to Cabot Cove nearly a decade ago, and we quickly bonded over our mutual love of books. Not just reading, but the need to support the printed page and, especially, libraries. I recall a particularly contentious town council meeting in which we needed to beat back a proposal to relocate our beloved library to make room for yet another high-end housing development. But Mimi launched into an impassioned speech that left those council members flirting with voting for the proposal abruptly changing their minds.</p><p>&#x201c;I leave you with this, ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; Mimi had concluded, turning to face the standing-room-only crowd. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t just a choice between books and buildings, wood and words; it&#x2019;s also a choice between dreams and development.</p><p>Mimi won me there and we&#x2019;d been close ever since. She was one of my closest friends in town, having taught me how to play bridge, canasta, and pinochle, though gin rummy remained my favorite. She had come from old money and had settled in Cabot Cove long before it became fashionable to do so. We seldom, if ever, talked about our personal lives, but rather our favorite books over the years. We rarely agreed, which seemed to draw us even closer. I&#x2019;ve bonded with people over many things through the years, but never over anything as effectively as books.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I intend to make a sizable donation to the library in Jean&#x2019;s name,&#x201d; Mimi said. &#x201c;Perhaps to name a new collection. What was her favorite genre?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Anything but mystery,&#x201d; I told her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m being serious here, Jessica.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I. She was a fan of classical fiction and looked forward to the day, she used to say, when I finally wrote a real book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe, but only in part. She used to read my books only to offer me critiques of what she deemed the more relevant parts, all of three or four pages, normally. She did that for all forty-seven of my books, and I&#x2019;ll miss her doing it when number forty-eight comes out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A clever way of letting you know she&#x2019;d read them.&#x201d; Mimi nodded, dabbing her eyes with a folded-over handkerchief, more to keep her makeup in place than out of grief.</p><p>Mimi hadn&#x2019;t seemed to have aged in the years I&#x2019;d known her; if anything, she looked younger. I knew how vain she was about her appearance, just as I knew how loath she was to the surgical methods to which many women resorted. She&#x2019;d become a health fiend in recent years and an obsessive follower of new diets meant to assure eternal youth. We&#x2019;d first met when she caught me jogging along the sea and then again when I was riding my bicycle through town. She&#x2019;d thought I&#x2019;d eschewed driving to get more exercise until I confessed it was because I never learned how to drive.</p><p>&#x201c;But I heard you had your pilot&#x2019;s license,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d remarked.</p><p>&#x201c;I do, thanks to my late husband, Frank, who taught me how to fly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But not drive? Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not a lot of accidents up in the air, Ms. Van Dorn,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said.</p><p>&#x201c;So long as you don&#x2019;t run out of fuel,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d quipped. &#x201c;And call me Mimi.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you at the reception, then,&#x201d; Mimi resumed today, angling away from me to cross the street toward her car, parked away from the funeral procession.</p><p>Most of the rest of the crowd had moved toward the parking lot that adjoined the church. I saw Mimi reach the street and noticed she&#x2019;d dropped her handkerchief on the grassy strip we&#x2019;d been standing on. I stooped to retrieve it, rising to see her pause in the middle of the road, speaking heatedly into her cell phone&#x2014;as an SUV, an old Jeep Cherokee, suddenly wheeled around the corner, picking up speed, headed directly at Mimi.</p><p>I lurched into motion, charging into the street and practically leaping into Mimi just before the Jeep would have struck her, the two of us locked in an uneasy embrace as we spun to the other side of the road and squeezed between two parked cars.</p><p>&#x201c;Jessica,&#x201d; a white-faced Mimi managed to utter, stiff and pale with shock.</p><p>&#x201c;One funeral for the day is enough,&#x201d; I said, forcing a smile even though I was shaking like a leaf.</p><p>I walked off toward the car belonging to the Friends of the Library member who&#x2019;d be driving me to the reception to get things prepared. Cocking my gaze backward to make sure Mimi was okay, I spotted her back on her phone, yelling at whoever was on the other end of the line. Then I peered down the street, as if expecting the old Jeep Cherokee to come roaring back.</p><p>But it had disappeared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The Cabot Cove Friends of the Library thought it fitting to host a reception at the library after Jean&#x2019;s funeral. Her replacement, the great Doris Ann, had missed the ceremony in order to supervise the catering team&#x2019;s setup and to make sure they didn&#x2019;t damage any of the books in the process. Doris Ann didn&#x2019;t greet me with the likes of &#x201c;What will it be, Jessica&#x2014;more books on poisons?&#x201d; but she was always there to guide my research efforts, whether they be by traditional page or Internet site. Doris Ann had brought our little library into the twenty-first century, making it more popular, and relevant, than ever, and she&#x2019;d jumped at the chance to organize the reception to honor her predecessor as Cabot Cove librarian.</p><p>Still shaken by Mimi&#x2019;s nearly being struck by that Jeep, I ducked away from the funeral cortege and skipped the grave-site portion in order to help Doris Ann and to act as official greeter for arriving guests on behalf of the Friends. I&#x2019;d been going to more and more funerals as I grew older&#x2014;expected for sure, but no easier to stomach. When the number reached as many real-life murders as I&#x2019;d solved, maybe I should take that as a sign to move somewhere where nobody was older than thirty.</p><p>Our little library dated back to the time when Cabot Cove had been no more than a fishing village, offering entertaining respite to wives while their husbands were at sea for weeks at a time. I can picture any number of them devouring Hawthorne and Melville, though I suspect Moby-Dick never ranked among their favorites. Losing themselves in this book or that by candlelight would&#x2019;ve made for the ideal distraction from the long nights spent alone fretting over the fate of their husbands, while their children slept soundly. I like to think that the many readers of J. B. Fletcher come to my mysteries for a similarly entertaining distraction, and I revel more than anything in those who profess to have lost themselves in my books, for a short time anyway.</p><p>In addition to the classics, Jean O&#x2019;Neil&#x2019;s tastes in fiction seemed to run to more exotic, far-flung adventures, as she used her reading as a travelogue to visit places her deteriorating body prevented her from ever seeing in person. I recall she had a special fascination with Tahiti, but I never learned precisely why.</p><p>And now I never would. As Doris Ann and I supervised the efforts of Cabot Cove Catering in repurposing our local world of books, I tried not to fixate on the finality that came with funerals and the increasing number of them I&#x2019;d been attending. I resolved again to reach out to Grady to schedule a visit.</p><p>The first guests started streaming in the very moment the setup was complete. Most seemed to bypass the cold cuts and salads for the dessert table, accompanied by old-fashioned urns of the coffee that Cabot Cove Catering was known for. Dr. Seth Hazlitt, Cabot Cove&#x2019;s own resident physician, was grousing in a corner with cup in hand, looking warm and uncomfortable in a dark tweed suit that made for a stark contrast with the white or khaki linen garb that had long been his trademark around town.</p><p>&#x201c;Hiding, Seth?&#x201d; I said, tossing a smile his way.</p><p>&#x201c;If I wanted to hide in a library, Jess, I&#x2019;d take up post in the science section, since nobody reads science anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are far too many who don&#x2019;t read anything at all these days.&#x201d;</p><p>He toasted me with his cup. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s a good thing for you that there are enough that still do, ayuh.&#x201d; Seth hesitated, his entire demeanor seeming to stiffen. &#x201c;She fired me, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who fired you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jean O&#x2019;Neil. I&#x2019;d been treating her MS for years, even consulted with experts down at the Brigham in Boston for the latest treatments and protocols. Then she fired me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know a patient could fire a doctor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, replaced. With that clinic the zoning board approved for some ungodly reason.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Technically, the Clifton Clinic is a private hospital, Seth, and they didn&#x2019;t need anyone&#x2019;s permission in Cabot Cove because they set up shop outside our boundaries.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still claim a Cabot Cove address, though, don&#x2019;t they, Jess?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I said&#x2014;technically.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth took another sip of his coffee. &#x201c;I think they killed her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Multiple sclerosis killed Jean. She credited them with buying her another year, thanks to that clinical trial.&#x201d;</p><p>Seth&#x2019;s expression was hovering somewhere between a snicker and a snarl. &#x201c;A clinical trial Brigham and Women&#x2019;s Hospital knew nothing about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a big world out there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not in medicine, it&#x2019;s not. I may be an old country doctor, but I&#x2019;ve been working the Internet since I delivered the Mercer twins back in 1996, and I can&#x2019;t find anything about this experimental protocol anywhere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It bought Jean another nine decent months, Seth.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which I couldn&#x2019;t buy her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that,&#x201d; I said, the loudening hum of voices in my ear telling me the lobby was starting to fill up.</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to,&#x201d; Seth Hazlitt said, in a tone I&#x2019;d never quite heard him use before. &#x201c;Jean did when she fired me. Go on now, Jess. Leave an old man to his misery and continue with your hosting duties.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;d rather talk to you.&#x201d;</p><p>He drained the rest of his coffee. &#x201c;I need a refill,&#x201d; he said, and walked off.</p><p>No sooner had Seth Hazlitt taken his leave than Mimi Van Dorn appeared in almost the very spot he&#x2019;d occupied, looking none the worse for wear after nearly being struck by that Jeep Cherokee.</p><p>&#x201c;You certainly know how to throw a bash, Jessica,&#x201d; she said, as the many residents of Cabot Cove continued to stream in to pay their respects.</p><p>&#x201c;I think the credit for that belongs to Jean.&#x201d;</p><p>I reached out and brushed some stray crumbs from the jacket of Mimi&#x2019;s designer suit. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want anything to make you less becoming, especially while wearing black.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes scorned me. &#x201c;Such a keen eye for observation, and yet the suit is charcoal gray.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So it is,&#x201d; I said, still not able to tell the difference.</p><p>&#x201c;And if it hadn&#x2019;t been you, it would be stained with red right now and plenty of it. And I&#x2019;d be somewhere else entirely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wh...</p></p><h2>Top Dog: The Story of Marine Hero Lucca</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Secret Service Dogs</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Soldier Dogs </i>delivers the incredible, true story of K-9 Marine hero Lucca, and the handlers who fought alongside her through two bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br></b><br>"Maria Goodavage knocks it out of the park in this fast paced, spell binding page turner"&nbsp;<b>--John W.

He kept clear of the path that meandered through hard clumps of dirt that looked nothing like the rich soil of his New England roots. The road less traveled&#x2014;ideally, no road at all&#x2014;was the safest from homemade bombs sowed by the Taliban. This was the Nahri Saraj District, in southern Afghanistan&#x2019;s Helmand River valley, and a war unlike those of previous generations.</p><p>Rod watched his dog, a German shepherd&#x2013;Belgian Malinois mix, who was thirty feet ahead and inspecting the land for IEDs. His eyes swept the area, keeping watch for anything suspicious. Unlike much of the agricultural land around here, this field was barren, not a sea of young poppies a month away from opium harvest. Furrows here and there hinted at past crops, but it was mostly flat, which made for easy maneuvering. In the distance, a compound, a tree line, and farther out, some worn-down old mountains.</p><p>Rod continued walking and observing. He could see his dog trotting with purpose, nose down, tail up, knowing just what to do. It was March 23, 2012, just one month shy of her sixth anniversary as a marine. With two deployments behind her, she was an old pro at the business of sniffing improvised explosive devices while off leash. &#x201c;Good girl, Mama Lucca,&#x201d; he said under his breath.</p><p><i>Lucca Bear. Lucca Pie. Bearcat Jones. Mama Lucca.</i> The twelve Special Forces soldiers had come to know military working dog Lucca K458 by all the nicknames Rod used for her&#x2014;the terms of endearment she had inspired during her career. She had led more than four hundred missions, and no one had gotten hurt by an IED when they were with her.</p><p><i>Mama Lucca</i> was the name that had stuck lately. She was the only one at their remote combat outpost the Green Berets felt comfortable hugging after a tough day or when they missed home. She was more experienced than some of the soldiers, and the maternal moniker was a natural fit.</p><p>Rod saw Lucca moving close to the narrow dirt path. &#x201c;Lucca, come!&#x201d; he called. She paused for a beat, looked at him, and kept sniffing. That wasn&#x2019;t normal. She almost always listened. But Rod could sense she was onto something. He didn&#x2019;t want to distract her, so he let her continue, watching her intently in case he needed to steer her clear of suspicious-looking spots. She walked back and forth, nose to the ground, and every few steps she turned more quickly, as she traced the scent to its point of origin. Lucca&#x2019;s luxuriant tail gave a few high, quick wags, looking momentarily like a victory flag. She stopped and stared at Rod.</p><p>He got the message, automatically imagining her words. <i>Hey, Dad, got one right here.</i> He called her back and praised her with his voice an octave higher than normal. &#x201c;Good girl, Lucca!&#x201d; He patted her side a few times but left the Kong in his cargo pocket because throwing a rubber reward in a place like this was a bad idea.</p><p>&#x201c;Ben,&#x201d; he called to the engineer, who was close behind. &#x201c;Lucca just responded, right there.&#x201d; He pointed to the spot with four fingers extended together.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;K, we&#x2019;ll take care of it,&#x201d; Ben said. &#x201c;Nice work, Mama Lucca.&#x201d;</p><p>Rod shifted their course to the left to keep Lucca away from the IED and the trail. She trotted ahead for about twenty-five feet, spun around, and headed back toward him. Rod kept close watch, realizing she may have locked onto the scent of another explosive. Where there&#x2019;s one, there&#x2019;s often at least one more.</p><p>The cloud of gray smoke erupted before Rod heard the explosion. A scream pierced through the boom, and a sickening thud followed. Rod couldn&#x2019;t see Lucca through the thick mass that hung in the air. He shouted, &#x201c;<i>No!</i>&#x201d; and squeezed his helmet hard between his hands, hoping he&#x2019;d wake up from every dog handler&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Radios around him buzzed into a frenzy, but he didn&#x2019;t hear words, just felt the surge of adrenaline that instantly made Lucca his sole focus.</p><p>As the curtain of debris curled away, he could make out his dog. She had dragged herself up and was standing, dazed, alive. Rod dashed toward her. He didn&#x2019;t think about the IEDs that could be between him and her. Lucca could take only a few unsteady steps before Rod reached her. He leaned down and swept her up in his arms, trying not to notice the smell of her burned fur and flesh.</p><p>Snipers struck at times like this. Rod wanted to run to the tree line with his dog to hide her from them, but the blood poured from her leg and he couldn&#x2019;t take a chance she would bleed out.</p><p>He laid her on the ground and ripped a combat application tourniquet from just inside his flak jacket. They were in easy reach. He could grab a tourniquet and apply it with one hand to save his own life or anyone else&#x2019;s.</p><p>The blood streamed, and the soil softened under Lucca. He saw clearly now that her left paw and a few inches above it had been torn away in the blast, exposing the bone, muscle, and tendons of her midleg. It was like something out of the dog anatomy images Rod and his classmates had studied in canine school, only with an alarming coat of red. Lucca panted hard, whimpering quietly every few breaths.</p><p><i>Focus, focus,</i> Rod told himself. He wrapped the tourniquet strap around her shoulder, twisted the plastic stick. The bleeding slowed. Good. He picked her up again and cradled her close. She melted into him, relaxing as he ran with her to the tree line sixty feet away. He gently placed her down again, and the Green Berets pulled security around them, weapons and eyes facing outward, protecting the dog team.</p><p>Rod grabbed another tourniquet and positioned it closer to Lucca&#x2019;s injury. She had bled all over his pants as he carried her. &#x201c;An extra tourniquet never killed anyone, right, Lucca?&#x201d; He secured it.</p><p>Scott, an 18-Delta medic, ran over. Rod drew his first conscious breath since the explosion. Special Forces medics are some of the most experienced and efficient medical trauma technicians in the world, and veterinary care is one of their many areas of expertise. Scott checked the tourniquets and injected Lucca in the thigh with a dose of morphine. Her panting slowed, her body relaxed, but she remained aware, eyes open. They checked out the burns on her neck, chest, and face and bandaged her leg and shoulder. Scott took a Sharpie from his aid bag and wrote <i>1400 </i>on the time tag of the upper tourniquet.</p><p>Lucca shifted her gaze to the sky. Rod looked and saw the medevac helicopter chopping its way toward them. The Black Hawk landed just far enough away that the wash didn&#x2019;t disturb Lucca. They loaded her up, and Rod got in.</p><p>Special Forces Sergeant Jake Parker turned around briefly from his lookout and gave his friend a thumbs-up. Rod returned it, and the Black Hawk rose straight up and headed east toward Camp Leatherneck.</p><p><i>Goddamned IEDs,</i> Parker thought as the helicopter disappeared and the farmland became silent. <i>That dog had better not die.</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>First in Class</p><p>THE FAMILIAR SMELL of dogs and disinfectant cleanser greeted Marine Staff Sergeant Chris Willingham as he and four other Americans walked into the kennel in Israel. From the dead silence just moments before, a cacophony of barks erupted and bounced off the concrete walls like something dangerous. Only it wasn&#x2019;t. Willingham liked the sound, the warm exuberance.</p><p>He was used to riotous canine greetings from his years at much larger military kennels stateside. Back at Lackland Air Force Base, the heart of the U.S. Military Working Dog Program, the barking came from dozens of dogs at a time&#x2014;a heavy-metal band with treble and base on max volume. He had spent the last three years there training dogs and instructing handlers and before that was a dog handler at Camp Lejeune. The Israel-based canine ensemble, while far smaller than those he&#x2019;d worked with in the U.S., still provided the rush he got from entering a military dog kennel.</p><p>April 23, 2006. This was the day he had been looking forward to since arriving in Tel Aviv a couple of weeks earlier. At his side was longtime dog handler Staff Sergeant Kristopher Knight, Willingham&#x2019;s close marine pal, who was also a trainer and instructor at Lackland and played a mean game of Texas Hold&#x2019;em with him and the other handlers on Friday nights. Two other marine dog handlers, Sergeant Rob Bowker and Sergeant Christopher Baity, and the U.S. Marine Corps K-9 program manager, William Childress, rounded out the canine contingent that traveled halfway around the world to learn about off-leash dog handling from the people who did it best.</p><p>They had landed in Israel just before Passover week, which turned out to be a bad time to deal with the government documents and official paperwork required for their visit. Not that they had any complaints about a few extra days at the Isrotel Tower hotel, with its sweeping views of the Mediterranean and its beachfront location. The hotel was close to the U.S. Embassy, which was the reason they&#x2019;d been booked there, but that wasn&#x2019;t high up on the handlers&#x2019; list of favorite features.</p><p>As much as Willingham was enjoying Tel Aviv, he was ready to immerse himself in the world of dogs as soon as everything was good to go. He missed them. He&#x2019;d been working with military dogs intensively for the last six years and he wasn&#x2019;t looking for a break. The drive to the headquarters of Oketz, the elite K-9 unit of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), would take only a half hour when they finally got the paperwork squared away. So close, yet so far. He was eager to get to a place where he could once again speak his native tongue: dog.</p><p>Oketz had been producing excellent bomb-detection dogs trained to work off leash. In the U.S., these canines, known as specialized search dogs (SSDs), were fairly new additions to the four-legged forces. The U.S. Department of Defense wanted a few top American handlers to learn how to train and work with these dogs. Childress had sought out four seasoned handlers to go to Israel for an intensive eight-month specialized search dog program designed specifically for the Americans. The handlers needed to be sergeant or above, with a solid foundation of military dog knowledge. This would make it easier to absorb and apply the techniques being taught and to go back to the U.S. and train other dog teams.</p><p>And now the handpicked marines were about to meet the dogs who would be at their sides for the next few years. Most likely, months at a time would be spent in the IED-infested streets, compounds, and rural areas of Iraq&#x2014;just a few hundred miles east of here. Their lives and the lives of countless others could depend on these dogs and on the extensive training the teams would receive during the next eight months.</p><p>Willingham&#x2019;s heart rate amped up as their head instructor, an IDF dog trainer of Russian origin named Michael (<i>Mi-kie-el</i>), unfolded the paper that would reveal the results of his matchmaking.</p><p>&#x201c;Knight, you&#x2019;ve got Rocky. Baity, you have Rona. Bowker, Yona is yours. Willingham, you get Lucca.&#x201d;</p><p>Four simple sentences, the die cast.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got five minutes. Go meet your dogs,&#x201d; he told them.</p><p>The men surveyed their new partners. Three barked in steady rhythms. The two loudest whirled round incessantly, pausing only briefly to catch eye contact with whoever glanced their way.</p><p>The fourth dog stood wagging a resplendent auburn tail, not saying a word, her slightly open mouth set in what Willingham swore was a smile, as if pleased, even delighted.</p><p>&#x201c;Lucca!&#x201d; Willingham entered her kennel and knelt down beside her. Lucca wagged harder and her back half wriggled with excitement while she inspected the man before her. Taller than most she had met, muscular, shaved head, beaming smile.</p><p>Willingham stroked her head and neck while looking over his new partner. German shepherd and Belgian Malinois in one dog. The best of both worlds, if the mix settles right. Hard to tell where one breed began and the other ended, but she was a beaut. And those eyes. He&#x2019;d never seen anything like them before on any breed. She seemed to have real eyebrows, small, dark, and deeply expressive while they danced over her large, calm eyes. A charcoal line went from the outside corners of her eyes all the way back to her ears, like a smoky cat eye in heavy pencil, and she had a little black beauty mark on each cheek. From each mark grew three long whiskers.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, Lucca, you ready to do this thing? I&#x2019;m Chris. We&#x2019;re about to start this journey. I have no idea what the future entails, what tomorrow is about, but I&#x2019;m really excited you&#x2019;re my dog.&#x201d;</p><p>Her tail swept out widely, from side to side. He noticed that the very end of her tail was black. It reminded him of an old story his mamaw had once told him about a boy dipping a girl&#x2019;s braids in an inkwell.</p><p>&#x201c;SIT!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Zit!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sitz!&#x201d;</p><p>School began early the next morning. The dogs, it turned out, hadn&#x2019;t received any training, at least none that was noticeable. Lucca couldn&#x2019;t even sit when Willingham asked her&#x2014;no matter what language he tried.</p><p>IDF canine experts had purchased the dogs during a recent trip to Europe. The dogs were all about two years old and came from breeders known for producing quality working dogs. The U.S. Military Working Dog Program gets most of its dogs from Europe as well. In countries like the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Germany, working dog sports have been going strong for up to a century, so there&#x2019;s an abundance of dogs bred for the kind of work military and police dogs do every day. The breeders and the vendors who raise them don&#x2019;t generally put much into training the dogs. They figure that&#x2019;s best left to the countries that buy them.</p><p>Lucca&#x2019;s home country was the Netherlands. Even though the Dutch and German words for <i>sit</i>&#x2014;<i>zit </i>and <i>sitz,</i> respectively&#x2014;are almost twins to the English word, he tried both languages in case some nuance of the word made her recognize it. But Lucca, Willingham&#x2019;s little Dutch girl, just stood there wagging. The lack of training didn&#x2019;t surprise the Americans. It&#x2019;s often best when a dog is a blank slate. That&#x2019;s how the U.S. military buys them: more raw material than ready-to-wear. The tailoring is up to the trainers and handlers.</p><p>The first several days together would be all about building rapport. Standard procedure. The sergeants-turned-students knew that rapport was everything. Without it, a dog won&#x2019;t work, or at least won&#x2019;t work reliably. When you&#x2019;re searching for homemade bombs in war-torn countries, halfhearted detection doesn&#x2019;t cut it. The dog has to want to work, has to crave that K-9 paycheck&#x2014;a combination of heartfelt praise from a handler and a rubber toy such as a Kong or tennis ball.</p><p>What struck the Americans as unusual was that this bond would initially be forged over food. &#x201c;For the next week, you are going to feed the dogs by hand,&#x201d; Michael announced. Willingham and Knight looked at each other, eyebrows raised. This was a new tactic for making friends out of military dogs. In the U.S., using food to train military dogs was the sign of a lazy handler or an unmotivated dog. But they figured that if Oketz d...</p></p><h2>Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (Movie Tie-in Edition)</h2><p><b>The book that inspired the hit film!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Sundance U.S. Dramatic Audience Award<br> Sundance Grand Jury Prize<br> &nbsp;<br><i>This is the funniest book you&#x2019;ll ever read about death. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> It is a universally acknowledged truth that high school sucks.

Without answering the obvious question&#x2014;just <em>why</em> is he writing" this stupid book"?&#x2014;Greg lets readers in on plenty else. His filmmaking ambitions. His unlikely friendship with the unfortunately short, chain-smoking, foulmouthed, African-American Earl of the title. And his unlikelier friendship with Rachel, the titular "dying girl."

Lawhead is an internationally acclaimed author of mythic history and imaginative fiction. His novels include <i>Hood</i>, Book One in the King Raven Trilogy, <i>Patrick</i>, The Song of Albion trilogy, the<br>Dragon King trilogy and The Pendragon Cycle series. Lawhead makes his home in Oxford, England, with his wife.<p> <strong>Prologue</strong></p> <p>The pig was young and wary, a yearling boar timidly testing the wind for strange scents as it ventured out into the honey-coloured light of a fast-fading day. Bran ap Brychan, Prince of Elfael, had spent the entire day stalking the greenwood for a suitable prize, and he meant to have this one. </p> <p> Eight years old and the king's sole heir, he knew well enough that he would never be allowed to go out into the forest alone. So rather than seek permission, he had simply taken his bow and four arrows early that morning and stolen from the caer unnoticed. This hunt, like the young boar, was dedicated to his mother, the queen. </p> <p> She loved the hunt and gloried in the wild beauty and visceral excitement of the chase. Even when she did not ride herself, she would ready a welcome for the hunters with a saddle cup and music, leading the women in song. "Don't be afraid," she told Bran when, as a toddling boy, he had been dazzled and a little frightened by the noise and revelry. "We belong to the land. Look, Bran!" She lifted a slender hand toward the hills and the forest rising like a living rampart beyond. "All that you see is the work of our Lord's hand. We rejoice in his provision." </p> <p> Stricken with a wasting fever, Queen Rhian had been sick most of the summer, and in his childish imaginings, Bran had determined that if he could present her with a stag or a boar that he had brought down all by himself, she would laugh and sing as she always did, and she would feel better. She would be well again. </p> <p> All it would take was a little more patience and . . . </p> <p> Still as stone, he waited in the deepening shadow. The young boar stepped nearer, its small pointed ears erect and proud. It took another step and stopped to sample the tender shoots of a mallow plant. Bran, an arrow already nocked to the string, pressed the bow forward, feeling the tension in his shoulder and back just the way Iwan said he should. "Do not aim the arrow," the older youth had instructed him. "Just <em>think</em> it to the mark. Send it on your thought, and if your thought is true, so, too, will fly the arrow." </p> <p> Pressing the bow to the limit of his strength, he took a steadying breath and released the string, feeling the sharp tingle on his fingertips. The arrow blazed across the distance, striking the young pig low in the chest behind the front legs. Startled, it flicked its tail rigid, and turned to bolt into the wood . . . but two steps later its legs tangled; it stumbled and went down. The stricken creature squealed once and tried to rise, then subsided, dead where it fell. </p> <p> Bran loosed a wild whoop of triumph. The prize was his! </p> <p> He ran to the pig and put his hand on the animal's sleek, slightly speckled haunch, feeling the warmth there. "I am sorry, my friend, and I thank you," he murmured as Iwan had taught him. "I need your life to live." </p> <p> It was only when he tried to shoulder his kill that Bran realised his great mistake. The dead weight of the animal was more than he could lift by himself. With a sinking heart, he stood gazing at his glorious prize as tears came to his eyes. It was all for nothing if he could not carry the trophy home in triumph. </p> <p> Sinking down on the ground beside the warm carcass, Bran put his head in his hands. He could not carry it, and he would not leave it. What was he going to do? </p> <p> As he sat contemplating his predicament, the sounds of the forest grew loud in his ears: the chatter of a squirrel in a treetop, the busy click and hum of insects, the rustle of leaves, the hushed flutter of wings above him, and then . . . </p> <p> "Bran!" </p> <p> Bran started at the voice. He glanced around hopefully. </p> <p> "Here!" he called. "Here! I need help!" </p> <p> "Go back!" The voice seemed to come from above. He raised his eyes to see a huge black bird watching him from a branch directly over his head. </p> <p> It was only an old raven. "Shoo!" </p> <p> "Go back!" said the bird. "Go back!" </p> <p> "I won't," shouted Bran. He reached for a stick on the path, picked it up, drew back, and threw it at the bothersome bird. "Shut up!" </p> <p> The stick struck the raven's perch, and the bird flew off with a cry that sounded to Bran like laughter. "Ha, ha, haw! Ha, ha, haw!" </p> <p> "Stupid bird," he muttered. Turning again to the young pig beside him, he remembered what he had seen other hunters do with small game. Releasing the string on his bow, he gathered the creature's short legs and tied the hooves together with the cord. Then, passing the stave through the bound hooves and gripping the stout length of oak in either hand, he tried to lift it. The carcass was still too heavy for him, so he began to drag his prize through the forest, using the bow. </p> <p> It was slow going, even on the well-worn path, with frequent stops to rub the sweat from his eyes and catch his breath. All the while, the day dwindled around him. </p> <p> No matter. He would not give up. Clutching the bow stave in his hands, he struggled on, step by step, tugging the young boar along the trail, reaching the edge of the forest as the last gleam of twilight faded across the valley to the west. </p> <p> "Bran!" </p> <p> The shout made him jump. It was not a raven this time, but a voice he knew. He turned and looked down the slope toward the valley to see Iwan coming toward him, long legs paring the distance with swift strides. </p> <p> "Here!" Bran called, waving his aching arms overhead. "Here I am!" </p> <p> "In the name of all the saints and angels," the young man said when he came near enough to speak, "what do you think you are doing out here?" </p> <p> "Hunting," replied Bran. Indicating his kill with a hunter's pride, he said, "It strayed in front of my arrow, see?" </p> <p> "I see," replied Iwan. Giving the pig a cursory glance, he turned and started away again. "We have to go. It's late, and everyone is looking for you." </p> <p> Bran made no move to follow. </p> <p> Looking back, Iwan said, "Leave it, Bran! They are searching for you. We must hurry." </p> <p> "No," Bran said. "Not without the boar." He stooped once more to the carcass, seized the bow stave, and started tugging again. </p> <p> Iwan returned, took him roughly by the arm, and pulled him away. "Leave the stupid thing!" </p> <p> "It is for my mother!" the boy shouted, the tears starting hot and quick. As the tears began to fall, he bent his head and repeated more softly, "Please, it is for my mother." </p> <p> "Weeping Judas!" Iwan relented with an exasperated sigh. "Come then. We will carry it together." </p> <p> Iwan took one end of the bow stave, Bran took the other, and between them they lifted the carcass off the ground. The wood bent but did not break, and they started away again--Bran stumbling ever and again in a forlorn effort to keep pace with his long-legged friend. </p> <p> Night was upon them, the caer but a brooding black eminence on its mound in the centre of the valley, when a party of mounted searchers appeared. "He was hunting," Iwan informed them. "A hunter does not leave his prize." </p> <p> The riders accepted this, and the young boar was quickly secured behind the saddle of one of the horses; Bran and Iwan were taken up behind other riders, and the party rode for the caer. The moment they arrived, Bran slid from the horse and ran to his mother's chamber behind the hall. "Hurry," he called. "Bring the boar!" </p> <p> Queen Rhian's chamber was lit with candles, and two women stood over her bed when Bran burst in. He ran to her bedside and knelt down. "Mam! See what I brought you!" </p> <p> She opened her eyes, and recognition came to her. "There you are, my dearling. They said they could not find you." </p> <p> "I went hunting," he announced. "For you." </p> <p> "For me," she whispered. "A fine thing, that. What did you find?" </p> <p> "Look!" he said proudly as Iwan strode into the room with the pig slung over his shoulders. </p> <p> "Oh, Bran," she said, the ghost of a smile touching her dry lips. "Kiss me, my brave hunter." </p> <p> He bent his face to hers and felt the heat of her dry lips on his. "Go now. I will sleep a little," she told him, "and I will dream of your triumph." </p> <p> She closed her eyes then, and Bran was led from the room. But she had smiled, and that was worth all the world to him. </p> <p> Queen Rhian did not waken in the morning. By the next evening she was dead, and Bran never saw his mother smile again.

The shout rattled through the stone-flagged yard. "Bran! Get your sorry tail out here! We're leaving!" </p> <p> Red-faced with exasperation, King Brychan ap Tewdwr climbed stiffly into the saddle, narrowed eyes scanning the ranks of mounted men awaiting his command. His feckless son was not amongst them. Turning to the warrior on the horse beside him, he demanded, "Iwan, where is that boy?" </p> <p> "I have not seen him, lord," replied the king's champion. "Neither this morning nor at the table last night." </p> <p> "Curse his impudence!" growled the king, snatching the reins from the hand of his groom.

Even as he grounded his narratives in the intimate daily life of Germany, Broch was identifying the oceanic changes that would shortly sweep that life into the abyss.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether he is writing about a neurotic army officer (<i>The Romantic</i>), a disgruntled bookkeeper and would-be assassin (<i>The Anarchist</i>), or an opportunistic war-deserter (<i>The Realist</i>), Broch immerses himself in the twists of his characters&#x2019; psyches, and at the same time soars above them, to produce a prophetic portrait of a world tormented by its loss of faith, morals, and reason.</p><p><b>Hermann Broch</b> (1886&#x2013;1951) was born in Vienna, where he trained as an engineer and studied philosophy and mathematics. He gradually increased his involvement in the intellectual life of Vienna, becoming acquainted with Ludwig Wittgenstein, Sigmund Freud, and Robert Musil, among others.&nbsp;<i>The Sleepwalkers</i>&nbsp;was his first major work. In 1938, he was imprisoned as a subversive by the Nazis, but was freed and fled to the United States. In the years before his death, he was researching mass psychology at Yale University.&nbsp;<i>The Death of Virgil</i>&nbsp;originally appeared in 1945; his last major novel,&nbsp;<i>The Guiltless</i>, was published in 1950.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Fiber Menace: The Truth About The Leading Role Of Fiber In Diet Failure, Constipation, Hemorrhoids, Etc.</h2><p>Fiber Menace is for people who believe fiber prevents cancers, reduces the risk of heart disease, regulates blood sugar, wards off diabetes, lowers appetite, induces weight loss, cleanses the colon, and eliminates constipation.Tragically, none of it is true, and Fiber Menace explains why it&#39;s the complete opposite. Most of those findings have been well known and widely publicized even before Fiber Menace&#39;s release. Here are some of the most striking examples:- Fiber doesn&#39;t ward off colon cancer, according to the Harvard School of Public Health: &#34;For years, Americans have been told to consume a high-fiber diet to lower the risk of colon cancer [...] Larger and better-designed studies have failed to show a link between fiber and colon cancer.&#34; Scores of other studies, cited in Fiber Menace, have demonstrated that fiber increases the risk of colon cancer. (p. 181)- Fiber doesn&#39;t prevent breast cancer either, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, it&#39;s the complete opposite: &#34;Carbohydrate intake was positively associated with breast cancer risk.&#34; Fiber happens to be a carbohydrate too, and carbohydrates are the only food that contains fiber. (p. 183)- Fiber doesn&#39;t reduce the risk of heart disease, according to the American Heart Association: &#34;A fiber supplement added to a diet otherwise high in saturated fat and cholesterol provides dubious cardiovascular advantage.&#34; Furthermore, these supplements caused &#34;reduced mineral absorption and a myriad of gastrointestinal disturbances&#34; - factors that in fact, contribute to heart disease. (p. 41)- Fiber doesn&#39;t counteract diabetes, according to the Harvard School of Public Health: &#34;Fiber intake has also been linked with the metabolic syndrome, a constellation of factors that increases the chances of developing heart disease and diabetes.&#34; Truth is, fiber requires more insulin or drugs to control blood sugar, and makes diabetes even more devastating. (p. 2</p><p>My training as a physician included many hours of nutrition, but fiber was only mentioned in regards to the effects of a deficiency. Never once did any of my professors consider the possibility that too much of what has always been considered a good thing&#39; could have such harmful or far-reaching consequences. The author&#39;s detailed description of the trauma imposed to the gastrointestinal mucosa by the expanding fiber is a vivid reminder that returning to the basics of GI function and logically thinking through what our bodies actually are designed to do with the food we eat, should be the first step on anyone&#39;s journey to recovery from digestive disorders. Thanks to the insights in this book I have slowly begun to change my approach to common patient symptoms, which I traditionally would have treated by suggesting increased fiber and more water to correct! So far the results are promising. Dr. John Turner, DC, CCSP, DIBCN --Wise Traditions Newsletter by Weston A.

While attentive to Luke&#39;s roles as a literary artist and theologian, I. Howard Marshall focuses primarily on Luke&#39;s role as a historian. He provides the reader with an accurate, balanced and holistic picture of the church&#39;s monumental first years as it sought to fulfill Christ&#39;s mandate to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series. The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries have long been a trusted resource for Bible study. Written by some of the world&#39;s most distinguished evangelical scholars, these twenty volumes offer clear, reliable and relevant explanations of every book in the New Testament. The Tyndale volumes are designed to help readers understand what the Bible actually says and what it means. The introduction to each volume gives a concise but thorough description of the authorship, date and historical background of the biblical book under consideration. The commentary itself examines the text section by section, drawing out its main themes. It also comments on individual verses and deals with problems of interpretation. The aim throughout is to get at the true meaning of the Bible and to make its message plain to readers today.</p><p>I. Howard Marshall is Honorary Research Professor of New Testament, University of Aberdeen."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A. Hagner, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"The evenness and quality of this series are remarkable."

One of Wilmington's most prominent and respected figures, a millionaire attorney and former state prosecutor, "Tommy" was a charming, softspoken family man. But in the weeks and months that followed Fahey's disappearance, investigators would gradually uncover the shocking truth: Capano was a steely manipulator driven by power and greed -- and capable of brutal murder. In a riveting narrative expertly documented by probing interviews, diary entries, and e-mail correspondence, and with superb insight into the twisted motivations of a killer, Ann Rule chronicles a real-life drama of Shakespearian proportions: ambitions fall, love turns to obsession, family names are tainted, the fa�ade of success crumbles -- and a beautiful but vulnerable young woman pays the ultimate price in a convoluted and deadly relationship.</p><p>Thomas Capano was a powerful man in Delaware. The golden child of a respected immigrant family, he had everything most people could ever hope for: money, a family he adored, widespread respect and admiration. His former lover Anne Marie Fahey was never that lucky. Her youth was a seemingly endless string of heartbreak, disappointment, and misery. Somehow, though, she managed to get through it all--her mother's death, abuse from her alcoholic father, devastating poverty--and make a niche for herself as a trusted secretary to Delaware's governor. Thirty years old, she had a whole new life ahead of her. She'd met a young man whom she hoped to someday marry and start a family with, and she finally seemed able to put her past behind her.<p> But Thomas Capano did not want to be put behind anyone. It was his sheer arrogance--the arrogance that couldn't accept rejection, that couldn't fathom being caught and convicted--that killed Anne Marie Fahey, and Ann Rule's telling of Fahey's story reveals the mind of a true monster. Capano's narcissism prevented him from feeling anything for anyone but himself, but the gripping narrative of <i>And Never Let Her Go</i> is surely the story that Fahey and her family would have wanted to be told. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i></p>THE SHATTERING CRIME STORY THAT SHOCKED THE NATION: THE THOMAS CAPANO MURDER CASE<p>On a June evening in 1996, 30-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, secretary to the governor of Delaware, vanished without a trace following a restaurant rendezvous with her secret lover of more than two years: Thomas Capano.

It's the boys--and one boy in particular--that give this raucous, tender novel its emotional kick. Daniel "Skippy" Juster is a breed apart from his friends, more sensitive than any of them, but never visibly reactive to the pressures that weigh heavily on him. The events that lead to his untimely (though tragicomic) death unfold scene by scene, in a chorus of perfectly executed moments that are powerful enough to make you laugh and weep at once. When you read <em>Skippy Dies</em>, you won't necessarily feel like a teenager again--and in fact, may realize you'd never want to--but you'll certainly appreciate how painful, exhilarating, and confusing it still is to grow up. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em><p><b>Paul Murray</b> was born in 1975.

Christ is beautiful, the gospel is beautiful, and at the heart of that beauty is the reality of our union with Christ by the Spirit.

Every aspect of Christian understanding is formed and informed by it; every aspect of faith, discipleship, and service radiates from it. Johnson reminds us that our proper preoccupation ought always to be the fostering of intimacy with Jesus Christ, who has been given to needy sinners for the sake of including them in his mercy and mission. This book will convince readers that all that the church believes, does, and aspires to coheres in our union with the One who remains the blessing, and whose including us in his life is the definitive truth of our lives.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Victor A.

Most helpful are his sections on how the mystery of the believer&#x2019;s union with Christ more fully explains our justification and sanctification. This is a compelling work for those in the church and the academy, and, if you are not careful, it might just change the way you think and talk about salvation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nicholas Gatzke, </strong>Senior<strong></strong>Pastor, Osterville Baptist Church, Osterville, Massachusetts</p><p>&#x201c;In this historically well-informed, theologically careful, and pastorally sensitive volume, Dr. Marcus Johnson seeks to remedy what he rightly calls &#x2018;the glaring omission of the theme of union with Christ in the soteriological understanding of the contemporary evangelical church.&#x2019; He convincingly demonstrates that the recovery of this central biblical theme helps us as Christians to understand better and more deeply the relation of Christ&#x2019;s person and work, the church as the body of Christ, and the glorious unity of our salvation in Christ.

Chapter by chapter he unfolds the mystery of our new life in Christ. He does not solve the mystery, but rather draws us into its wonders.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce K. Modahl, </strong>Senior Pastor, Grace Lutheran Church, River Forest, Illinois</p><p>&#x201c;Seeking the core of biblical Christianity, Marcus Johnson probes the understanding of salvation, focusing on restoring to keen awareness the reality of believers&#x2019; union in Christ as &#x2018;the essence and foundation of salvation.&#x2019; Pointed out among the factors contributing to the sad neglect of this essential doctrine is a too-timid fear of mystery and a too-bold confidence in reason. And in describing his own pilgrimage, Johnson considers persuasively that our union with Christ suffers from overemphasis on the work of Christ to the detriment of his person. Likewise, strong emphasis on the legal and forensic dimensions of justification has led to weak recognition of personal and participatory categories. Special care is paid to the salutary nature of the church. This book written from the heart speaks to the heart.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Charles Partee,</strong> P. C. Rossin Professor of Church History, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</p><p>&#x201c;The tendency in much contemporary evangelical thought is to view salvation as if it were the reception of an abstract and objectified commodity given on account of Christ yet apart from him, as if Christ were the agent and condition of our salvation, but not that salvation itself. Marcus Johnson demonstrates that this is neither the witness of the apostles nor the confession of the Protestant Reformers, who proclaimed salvation to be a life-giving, life-transforming participation in our incarnate substitute. Immensely important and timely, this volume provides a richly textured theology of salvation couched in the only context that allows soteriology to be truly intelligible, pastoral, and doxological&#x2015;the context constituted by the church and her sacraments.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John C.

This book is one of the few at the present time to offer a global synthesis of the main themes in the sacramental mystery in which the human and divine, the material and the spiritual realms are intimately intertwined. Paul Haffner outlines how the sacraments are the chief means in the Church through which God&#39;s people are reconciled to the Father, through His Son, by the power of the Holy Spirit. The treatise illustrates classical issues like the conditions for the validity and the efficacy of the sacraments, as well as the minister, recipient and effects of these sacred mysteries; it deals with particular topics like the necessity of Baptism, the sacrificial character of the Eucharist, and the nature of Marriage. As he examines each sacrament in turn, the author also explores how new ecumenical questions affect Christian sacramental understanding.</p><p></p><h2>The Discipline of Grace Study Guide</h2><p><i>The Discipline of Grace Study Guide</i> by Navigator author Jerry Bridges will help you unlock the mystery of what God does in bringing you to maturity in Christ.

We welcome this opportunity to respond. We would like to begin by clarifying a couple of points. First, our text does cover chemical reaction equilibria in detail (Chapters 14 and 15). In addition to deriving the fundamental equations from first principles, we present examples, practice problems, and homework problems covering single reactions in a single phase, multiple reactions in a single phase, multiple reactions between vapor and liquid phases, and electrolyte reactions with partitioning between vapor and liquid phases. We also cover energy balances for reacting systems. The coverage of reacting systems is comparable with other introductory chemical engineering textbooks. Regarding inclusion of additional examples and resources, it is very valuable to refer you to the text's web site. Amazon prohibits us from giving the link but you can find it if you search for &#x201c;Introductory Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics&#x201d;. We are continually supplementing our textbook through updates on this web site. You will find sample tests for each unit, supplemental homework problems, review modules, abbreviated presentation slides, computer spreadsheets and programs, virtual guided tours through real plants and equipment, links to phase diagrams, on-line databases, and many more resources. At present, we are developing review modules that carefully lead students through key concepts with reinforcing examples. By using the web efficiently, we hope to provide effective supplements for review and self-study. We hope that you will find these comments and our web resources to be useful. Please keep those Amazon suggestions and criticisms coming. <p>J.R. Elliott<br> C.T. Lira</p>Preface <br><br> "No happy phrase of ours is ever quite original with us; there is nothing of our own in it except some slight change born of our temperament, character, environment, teachings and associations."<br> --Mark Twain Thank you for your interest in our book. We have developed this book to address ongoing evolutions in applied thermodynamics and computer technology. Molecular perspective is becoming more important in the refinement of thermodynamic models for fluid properties and phase behavior. Molecular simulation is increasingly used for exploring and improving fluid models. While many of these techniques are still outside the scope of this text, these new technologies will be important to practicing engineers in the near future, and an introduction to the molecular perspective is important for this reason. We expect our text to continue to evolve with the chemical engineering field. <br><br> Computer technology has made process simulators commonplace in most undergraduate curriculums and professional work environments. This increase in computational flexibility has moved many of the process calculations from mainframe computers and thermodynamic property experts to the desktop and practicing engineers and students. This increase in computational ability also increases the responsibility of the individuals developing process simulations to choose meaningful models for the components in the system because most simulators provide even more options for thermodynamic models than we can cover in this text. We have included background and comparison on many of the popular thermodynamic models to address this issue. <br><br> Computational advances are also affecting education. Thus we have significant usage of equations of state throughout the text. We find these computational tools remove much of the drudgery of repetitive calculations, which permits more class time to be spent on the development of theories, molecular perspective, and comparisons of alternative models. We have included FORTRAN, Excel spreadsheets, TI85, and HP48 calculator programs to complement the text. The programs are summarized in the appendices. Solutions to cubic equations of state are no longer tedious with the handheld calculators available today for about $100. We provide programs for calculation of thermodynamic properties via the Peng-Robinson equation, vapor pressure programs, Peng-Robinson K-ratios and bubble pressures of mixtures, and van Laar and UNIFAC activity coefficients as well as several other utility programs. Our choice of the HP48 calculator is due to its being one of the first to provide a computer interface for downloading programs from a PC and provide calculator-to-calculator communication, which facilitates distribution of the programs. If all students in the class have access to these engineering calculators, as practiced at the University of Akron, questions on exams can be designed to apply to these programs directly. This obviates the need for traditional methods of reading charts for departure functions and K-ratios and enables treatment of modern methods like equations of state and UNIFAC. Spreadsheets have also improved to the point that they are powerful tools for solving engineering problems. We have chosen to develop spreadsheets for Microsoft� Excel because of the widespread availability. Certainly Mathcad�, Mathematica�, and other software could be used, but none has the widespread availability of spreadsheets. We have found the solver within Excel to provide a good tool for solving a wide variety of problems. We provide spreadsheets for thermodynamic properties, phase and reaction equilibria. High-level programming is still necessary for more advanced topics. For these applications, we provide compiled programs for thermodynamic properties and phase behavior. For an associating system, such as an alcohol, we provide the ESD equation of state. These programs are menu-driven and do not require knowledge of a computer language.<br><br> In a limited number of instances, we provide FORTRAN source code. We provide FORTRAN code because of our own abilities to program faster in FORTRAN, although other languages are finding increasing popularity in the engineering community. We have tried to avoid customization of the code for a specific FORTRAN compiler, which improves portability to other operating platforms but also limits the "bells and whistles" that a specific interface could provide. These programs provide a framework for students and practicing engineers to customize for their own applications. Energy and entropy balances are at the heart of process engineering calculations. We develop these approaches first using the ideal gas law or thermodynamic tables, then revisit the topics after developing equation-of-state techniques for thermodynamic properties. We are well aware of the concern that students often apply the ideal gas law inappropriately. Therefore we clearly mark equations using the ideal gas law or assuming a temperature-independent heat capacity. From a pedagogical standpoint, we are faced with the issues of developing first and second law balances, equations of state (and their departure functions) for fluid properties, and then combining the principles. We have found it best that students quickly develop ability and confidence in application of the balances with simple calculational procedures before introducing the equation of state. The balance concepts are typically more easily grasped and are essential for extension to later courses in the curriculum. Another benefit of this approach is that the later development of the equation of state can be directly followed by departure functions, and the reasons for needing properties such as enthalpy and entropy are well understood from the earlier emphasis on the balances. This enables students to focus on the development of the departure functions without being distracted by not completely understanding how these properties will be used. <br><br> Fugacity is another property which is difficult to understand. We have tried to focus on the need for a property which is a natural function of T and P, and also stress how it is related to departure functions. There are many ways to calculate fugacities (which provides many trees to block the view of the forest), and we have tried to provide tables and diagrams to show the inter-relations between fugacity coefficients, activity coefficients, ideal gases, ideal solutions, and real solutions. EXCLAMATION POINT icon, it means that an important point is made, or a useful equation has been introduced. Where you find an HP or TI icon, it means that a calculator program is available to assist in calculations. The calculator programs are sometimes not necessary, but extremely helpful. Where you find a DISK icon, it means that an Excel spreadsheet or a compiled program is available. In some cases, the program is simply convenient, but typically you will find that these calculations are tedious without the program. For calculator or PC icons, the program names are given by the icons. See the computer appendix or the readme files for specific program instructions. <br><br> We periodically update computer software and the computer appendix.

We welcome your suggestions for further improvements and enhancements. You may contact us easily at the email addresses below. Unfortunately, we will be unable to personally respond to all comments, although we will try. <br><br> Notes to Students <br><br> Computer programs facilitate the solution to homework problems, but should not be used to replace an understanding of the material. Always understand exactly which formulas are required before turning to the computer. Before using the computer, we recommend that you know how to solve the problem by hand calculations. If you do not understand the formulas in the spreadsheets it is a good indication that you need to do more studying before using the program so that the structure of the spreadsheet will make sense. When you understand the procedures, it should be obvious which spreadsheet cells will help you to the answer, and which cells are intermediate calculations. It is also helpful to rework example problems from the text using the software. <br><br> Acknowledgments <br><br> We would like to thank the many people who helped this work find its way to the classroom. We express appreciation to Professors Joan Brennecke, Mike Matthews, Bruce Poling, Ross Taylor, and Mark Thies, who worked with early versions of the text and provided suggestions for improve-ment.

As a bishop serving in fourth century Alexandria, Athanasius composed this essay in his early life and devoted it to a number of issues still debated by theologians today, including monotheism, spiritual salvation, and the divine nature of Jesus Christ.</p><p>ATHANASIUS, Bishop of Alexandria and one of the most illustrious defenders of the Christian faith, was born at Alexandria about the year 297. Before the outbreak of the Arian controversy, which began in 319, Athanasius had made himself known as the author of two essays addressed to a convert from heathenism, one of them entitled Against the Gentiles, and the other On the Incarnation of the Word. Both are of the nature of apologetical treatises, arguing such questions as monotheism, and the necessity of divine interposition for the salvation of the world; and already in the second may be traced that tone of thought respecting the essential divinity of Christ as the &#34;God-man&#34; for which he afterwards became conspicuous.Text: English, Latin (translation)</p><h2>Writing Strands, Level 3</h2><p>This book is for students who have finished <i>Writing Strands 2</i> or new students who are 8-12 years old.

This book contains question-and-answer sections in each chapter. <br> FIFTH EDITION</p><h2>Prometheus Bound (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)</h2><p>The myth of fire stolen from the gods appears in many pre-industrial societies. In Greek culture Prometheus the fire-stealer figures prominently in the poems of Hesiod, but in Prometheus Bound Hesiod&#39;s morality tale has been transformed into a drama of tragic tone and proportions. In the introduction, Mark Griffith examines how the dramatist has achieved this transformation, looking at the play from all angles - plot and characters, dramatic technique, style and metre. He includes a short section on the production of the play and on the questions of authenticity and date. The commentary guides the reader through problems of language, metre and content. An important feature of this volume is the appendix, which gathers together the existing fragments of the other two plays in the supposed Prometheus trilogy, quoting them in full in the original language and in translation, with short accompanying commentary. This is suitable for undergraduates and students in the upper forms of schools. It also deserves the serious attention of scholars. The introduction requires no knowledge of Greek and will interest students of drama and literature in other cultures too.</p><p>Featuring an insightful introduction, comprehensive commentary on plot, characters, structure, and other elements of the play, the complete Greek text and fragments, this new translation will be welcomed by students and scholars alike.Text: English, Greek</p><h2>NIV Zondervan Study Bible, Personal Size, Hardcover: Built on the Truth of Scripture and Centered on the Gospel Message</h2><p><p>&#x201c;This NIV Zondervan Study Bible is a tremendous tool for informed Bible reading and study.

While most scholarship on commodities focuses either on labor and production or on consumption and use, Anishanslin unifies both, examining the worlds of four identifiable people who produced, wore, and represented this object: a London weaver, one of early modern Britain&#x2019;s few women silk designers, a Philadelphia merchant&#x2019;s wife, and a New England painter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Blending macro and micro history with nuanced gender analysis, Anishanslin shows how making, buying, and using goods in the British Atlantic created an object-based community that tied its inhabitants together, while also allowing for different views of the Empire. Investigating a range of subjects including self-fashioning, identity, natural history, politics,&nbsp;and trade, Anishanslin makes major contributions both to the study of material culture and to our ongoing conversation about how to write history.</p><p><b>Zara Anishanslin</b> is assistant professor of history and art history at the University of Delaware."A stimulating text that sheds light on the interconnectedness of the British Atlantic World."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br>&#x201c;An insightful analysis of the intellectual and economic codependence of the North American colonies and the larger British Empire.&#x201d;&#x2014;Pamela A.

Clarke</strong> </p> <p>SORCERERS have their magic wands&#x2014;powerful, potentially dangerous tools with lives of their own. Witches have their familiars&#x2014;creatures disguised as household beasts that could, if they choose, wreak the witches' havoc. Mystics have their golems&#x2014;beings built of wood and tin brought to life to do their masters' bidding.</p> <p>We have our personal computers.</p> <p>PCs, too, are powerful creations that often seem to have a life of their own. Usually, they respond to a wave of a mouse or a spoken incantation by performing tasks we couldn't imagine doing ourselves without some sort of preternatural help. But even as computers successfully carry out our commands, it's often difficult to quell the feeling that there's some wizardry at work here.</p> <p>And then there are the times when our PCs, like malevolent spirits, rebel and open the gates of chaos onto our neatly ordered columns of numbers, our carefully wrought sentences, and our beautifully crafted graphics. When that happens, we're often convinced that we are, indeed, playing with power not entirely under our control. We become sorcerers' apprentices, whose every attempt to right things leads to deeper trouble.</p> <p>Whether our personal computers are faithful servants or imps, most of us soon realize there's much more going on inside those silent boxes than we really understand. PCs are secretive. Open their tightly sealed cases and you're confronted with poker-faced components. Few give any clues as to what they're about. Most of them consist of sphinx-like microchips that offer no more information about themselves than some obscure code printed on their impenetrable surfaces. The maze of circuit tracings etched on the boards is fascinating, but meaningless, hieroglyphics. Some crucial parts, such as the hard drive and power supply, are sealed with printed omens about the dangers of peeking inside&#x2014;omens that put to shame the warnings on a pharaoh's tomb.</p> <p>This book is based on two ideas. One is that the magic we understand is safer and more powerful than the magic we don't. This is not a hands-on how-to book. Don't look for any instructions for taking a screwdriver to this part or the other. But perhaps your knowing more about what's going on inside all those stoic components makes them a little less formidable when something does go awry. The second idea behind this book is that knowledge, in itself, is a worthwhile and enjoyable goal. This book is written to respond to your random musings about the goings-on inside that box you sit in front of several hours a day. If this book puts your questions to rest&#x2014;or raises new ones&#x2014;it will have done its job.</p> <p>At the same time, however, I'm trusting that knowing the secrets behind the magician's legerdemain won't spoil the show. This is a real danger. Mystery is often as compelling as knowledge. I'd hate to think that anything you read in this book takes away that sense of wonder you have when you manage to make your PC do some grand, new trick. I hope that, instead, this book makes you a more confident sorcerer.</p> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

Edited by Ronald Grigor Suny, an eminent historian and political scientist, <em>The Structure of Soviet History</em> illustrates both the revolutionary changes and the broad continuities in Soviet history. It discusses the history, not only of the Russian people, but of other Soviet peoples as well--the nationalities that made up the tsarist and Soviet empires and formed independent states in the early 1990s. This volume enables students to delve beyond traditional narratives to look at the building blocks of history--archival documents, memoirs, and interpretive essays by the leading experts in the field. Students will learn about the fall of the tsarist empire, the hopes and aspirations of the revolutionary years, the brutalities of the Stalin years, the attempts to reform the country in the last decades of Soviet power, and finally, the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of fifteen fragile republics. Rather than imposing a single view on students, <em>The Structure of Soviet History</em> allows them to come up with their own, fresh interpretations of a controversial and often misunderstood experience. <br> Organized chronologically and covering political, social, and cultural history from a variety of viewpoints, the readings examine all of the major events and principal interpretations of Soviet history. Selections include official pronouncements and dissident manifestos, public speeches and private letters, and previously untranslated documents. Suny's introductory essay provides the broad outlines of Soviet history, while the chapter introductions summarize the main features and historical debates of each period. Each document is prefaced by a brief headnote that identifies the author and places the work in context; explanatory notes are also included to define words and events that may not be familiar to students. A truly unique text, <em>The Structure of Soviet History</em> is ideal for use in undergraduate courses on the history of the Soviet Union as well as introductory courses on Soviet politics.</p><p>Ronald Grigor Suny is at University of Chicago.&#34;Excellent text.

Wealth is produced by an &#x201c;industrial army&#x201d; and every citizen receives the same wage. </p> <p> This edition contains a rich selection of appendices, including excerpts from Bellamy&#x2019;s <em>Equality</em> and other writings; contemporary responses (by William Morris, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and others); excerpts from utopian works by Morris and William Dean Howells; and an excerpt from Henry George&#x2019;s <em>Progress and Poverty</em>. </p></p><h2>The Poems of Alexander Pope: A reduced version of the Twickenham Text</h2><p>A splendid presentation of Pope&#x2019;s poems, excluding only his translations of Homer, this is the only one-volume edition that can lay claim to completeness and accuracy of text.&nbsp;It presents the corpus of Pope&#x2019;s poetry as printed in the highly praised Twickenham Edition, except for the 1712 version of <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> and other early versions of phrases preserved in the critical apparatus of the six-volume work. Pope&#x2019;s own notes to his poems are included, as well as a generous selection of the copious annotation in the Twickenham text.&nbsp;This reduced version of the unsurpassed standard edition of Pope will be of great value to all students and teachers of English literature. John Butt, Regius Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at Edinburgh University, is general editor of the Twickenham Edition.&nbsp;"The publishers are surely right in claiming that 'this should for long remain the standard one-volume edition of Pope's poems.'

Athos, Greece, to haul off monks engaged in a dangerously heretical practice known as Name Worshipping. Exiled to remote Russian outposts, the monks and their mystical movement went underground. Ultimately, they came across Russian intellectuals who embraced Name Worshipping&#x2015;and who would achieve one of the biggest mathematical breakthroughs of the twentieth century, going beyond recent French achievements.</p><p>Loren Graham and Jean-Michel Kantor take us on an exciting mathematical mystery tour as they unravel a bizarre tale of political struggles, psychological crises, sexual complexities, and ethical dilemmas. At the core of this book is the contest between French and Russian mathematicians who sought new answers to one of the oldest puzzles in math: the nature of infinity. The French school chased rationalist solutions. The Russian mathematicians, notably Dmitri Egorov and Nikolai Luzin&#x2015;who founded the famous Moscow School of Mathematics&#x2015;were inspired by mystical insights attained during Name Worshipping. Their religious practice appears to have opened to them visions into the infinite&#x2015;and led to the founding of descriptive set theory.</p><p>The men and women of the leading French and Russian mathematical schools are central characters in this absorbing tale that could not be told until now. <i>Naming Infinity</i> is a poignant human interest story that raises provocative questions about science and religion, intuition and �creativity.</p></p><p><p>Loren Graham is Professor Emeritus of the History of Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>Jean-Michel Kantor is a mathematician at the Institut de Math�matiques de Jussieu in Paris.</p>&#x201c;The intellectual drama will attract readers who are interested in mystical religion and the foundations of mathematics. The personal drama will attract readers who are interested in a human tragedy with characters who met their fates with exceptional courage.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Freeman Dyson</b><br><br>&#x201c;At the end of the nineteenth century, three young French mathematicians--�mile Borel, Ren� Baire and Henri Lebesgue--built on the work of Georg Cantor to conceive a new theory of functions that in a few years transformed mathematical analysis. When their work met with skepticism, they began to doubt it and abandoned further investigation. In Russia, under the leadership of Dmitry Egorov, a group of Moscow mathematicians picked up the torch. Animated by a mystical tradition known as Name Worshipping, they found the creativity to name the new objects of the French theory of functions. And they changed the face of the mathematical world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bernard Bru, emeritus, University of Paris V</b><br><br>&#x201c;A passionate confluence of mathematical creation and mystical practices is at the center of this extraordinary account of the emergence of set theory in Russia in the early twentieth century. The starkly drawn contrast with mathematical developments in France illuminates the story, and the book is electric with portraits of the great mathematicians involved: the tragic, the unfortunate, the villainous, the truly admirable. The authors offer an account of Infinity that is brief, deft, serious, and accessible to non-mathematicians, and their evocation of the mathematical circles of the period is so intimately written that one feels as if one had lived, worked, and suffered alongside the protagonists. Graham and Kantor have given us an amazing piece of mathematical history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Barry Mazur, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Last week I read one of the most interesting books I've encountered so far this year, <i>Naming Infinity: A True Story of Religious Mysticism and Mathematical Creativity</i>, by Loren Graham and Jean-Michel Kantor, just published by Harvard University Press. I'll be writing more about this book, but in the meantime I wanted to let you know about it. Many books in the science-and-religion conversation tediously cover the same ground. This book comes from a fresh angle--the world of mathematics and the world of "science" are not the same, but they overlap--and it tells a fascinating story. I found it absolutely riveting. And it's encouraging to see two secular scholars doing their best to be scrupulously fair in representing religious thinkers whose worldview is very different from their own.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Wilson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Books &amp; Culture</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It is a story of the persistence of intellectual life against the wrecking tide of history.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jascha Hoffman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In the early 20th century, mathematicians grappled with the concept of infinity, relying heavily on set theory to prove and define it. The French mathematicians, rationalists not fond of abstraction (particularly abstractions with spiritual overtones), went head-to-head with the Russians, who had always linked mathematics to philosophy, religion and ideology. Name Worshipping played a key role in bringing the two closer together. Graham and Kantor do a beautiful job of fleshing out the key players in this gripping drama--nothing less than a struggle to prove the existence of God.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Susan Salter Reynolds</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This absorbing book tells astonishing stories about some of the most important developments in mathematics of the past century...Perhaps the most moving section of the book is that dealing with the famous Moscow School of Mathematics in Soviet times. Its origins are traced to the Lusitania seminar established by Egorov and Luzin (the source of the name "Lusitania" is obscure). The enthusiasm that these teachers inspired in their students is clearly conveyed, as is the atmosphere of intellectual excitement, despite the freezing lecture rooms (the rule that lectures could not take place if the room temperature fell below -5C was ignored)...This is a remarkable book, illuminating the history of 20th-century mathematics and its practitioners. The stories it tells are important and too little known. It is clearly a labor of love and deserves a wide audience: it is an outstanding portrayal of mathematics as a fundamentally human activity and mathematicians as human beings.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Tony Mann</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The most unusual book I have read this year.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Alex Beam</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Fifty years ago, C. P. Snow gave a soon-to-be famous lecture on the "Two Cultures" of modern society, the culture of the humanities and the culture of science, and the need to bridge the gap between them. Today we are more likely to hear debates about the alleged gulf between science and religion. Both divides are bridged in this superb book, which takes us from French rationalism at the turn of the 20th century to a thriving center of world-class mathematics in Moscow, where the presiding figures were also devout Russian Orthodox believers of a mystical bent.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Wilson</b><b>, </b><b><i>Christianity Today</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Naming Infinity</i> is a short, accessible book about mathematical imagination...<i>Naming Infinity</i> is a straightforward, kinetic, and seductive read...In describing the life trajectories of their subjects, the authors are unafraid to take sides, show their sympathies, even judge. There is something refreshingly honest in their striving to be fair to their real-life characters without feigned impartiality. This considered generosity and the passion that shows itself in the copious quantities of documentary and anecdotal evidence gathered by Loren Graham in Russia, make the book a fascinating read...Just as a stimulating conversation, even when left incomplete, opens the mind to new ideas, Naming Infinity suggests new ways of thinking about mathematical creativity and intellectual excellence.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anna Razumnaya</b><b>, </b><b><i>theworld.org</i></b></p><h2>Winners Never Cheat: Everyday Values We Learned As Children but May Have Forgotten</h2><p>Next time someone tells you business can't be done ethically -- corners must be cut, negotiations can't be honest -- hand them Jon Huntsman's new book.&nbsp;He started with practically nothing, and made it to Forbes'list of America's Top 100 richest people. Huntsman's generous about sharing the credit, but in the 21st century, he's the nearest thing to a self-made multi-billionaire. Now, he presents the lessons of a lifetime: a passionate, inspirational manifesto for returning to the days when your word was your bond, a handshake was sacred, and swarms of lawyers weren't needed to back it up. This is no mere exhortation: it's&nbsp;a practical business book about how&nbsp;to listen to your moral compass, even as others ignore theirs. It's about how you build teams with the highest values, share success, take responsibility, and earn the rewards that only come with giving back. Huntsman's built his career and fortune on these principles.&nbsp; You don't live these principles just to 'succeed': you live them because they're right. But in an age of non-stop business scandal, Huntsman's life proves honesty is more than right: it's&nbsp;the biggest competitive differentiator.</p><p><p> <b>JON M.

Nobody would be happier about it than me.</p> <p>Over the past 30 years, I have taken some of America's biggest corporations to court, calling them to task for behavior that threatened people's health and livelihoods. From asbestos makers to tobacco purveyors to computer manufacturers, I have fought to make big companies more accountable in their business dealings.</p> <p>Ordinarily, you would not expect a trial lawyer to be particularly close with the CEO of a big corporation. So when people hear that Jon Huntsman and I are good friends, and have been for 15 years, they tend to scratch their heads. In the ecology of the business world, aren't we natural enemies? Don't our respective jobs put us at odds with each other? The answer to both questions is no. And the reason is simple: Jon Huntsman is not your average CEO.</p> <p>Jon is a true rarity in the corporate world: a hugely successful entrepreneur whose conscience is as sharp as his business sense, whose word is known as an unbreakable bond. From his very first job, picking potatoes in rural Idaho at age eight, to his current position of running the world's largest private chemical company, he has always put ethical concerns on equal, if not greater, footing than his business concerns. </p> <p>I could give you a laundry list of things Jon has done&#x2014;donating record-setting amounts to cancer treatment and research, tithing to his church, giving millions to colleges and universities&#x2014;but that still wouldn't give you a clear idea of why he's so unusual. His ethics go far deeper than simply making donations and glad-handing for good causes. They are at the core of his being. They are, for him, a way of life.</p> <p>In Plato's seminal work, <i>The Republic</i>, he gives us the notion of the ideal leader: the "philosopher-king." This is the man who possesses the perfect marriage of a philosophic mind and an ability to lead. As Plato wrote: "I need no longer hesitate to say that we must make our guardians philosophers. The necessary combination of qualities is extremely rare. Our test must be thorough, for the soul must be trained up by the pursuit of all kinds of knowledge to the capacity for the pursuit of the highest&#x2014;higher than justice and wisdom&#x2014;the idea of the good."</p> <p>Jon Huntsman has pursued "the idea of the good" all his life, and as the continued health of his companies show, he's more than able to lead. But the true test of ethics comes not when a person gives with nothing to lose. It comes when he gives with everything to lose. That's why Jon Huntsman is the right man to do this book. And there's no question that he's doing it at just the right time. In this age of Enron, Tyco, insider-trading scandals, and rampant corporate malfeasance, we need Jon Huntsman's voice and leadership more than ever.</p> <p>I hope Jon's book will remind us all that, like him, you can do well and do good at the same time. As a trial lawyer, I want every businessperson in America to read this book and take to heart Jon's example. Maybe then my fellow trial lawyers and I would have nothing left to do. </p> <p>There's nothing I'd like better.</p> <p>&#x2014;Wayne Reaud</p> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

Huxley, celebrated author of <i>Brave New World</i>, ignited a generation that chased utopian dreams and sought enlightenment through psychedelic drugs. Heard, an Anglo-Irish mystic, journeyed to California with Huxley in the 1930s to lay the foundations for the New Age and human potential movements. Wilson, the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, joined forces with Huxley and Heard in the 1940s and 1950s, when Wilson began a series of little-known experiments to see if LSD could be used to help diehard drunks.<br><br>Their life stories are gracefully brought together by veteran journalist Don Lattin. Lattin recounts his own rocky personal journey from 1960s and 1970s counter-culture, through the fast-living, cocaine-fueled 1980s and 1990s, to his long struggle to get sober. By weaving an intimate account of his own recovery with the lives of the book&#x2019;s three central characters, Lattin shows us the redemptive power of story telling, the strength of fellowship, and the power of living more compassionately, one day at a time.</p><p>&#x201c;It is difficult for me to hide my enthusiasm for this book. It is a fascinating biography/memoir with an abundance of heart&#x2015;courageously honest, philosophically nuanced, and peppered with the most delightful sense of humor. It&#x2019;s easy to be romantic about drugs and mysticism&#x2015;tougher to be both morally rigorous AND honestly ecstatic about the real openings they offer. I&#x2019;m grateful that Lattin can hold this tension while also weaving a mesmerizing story.&#x201d;&#x2015;Jeffrey Kripal, author of <i>Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion</i> <br><br>&#x201c;This extraordinary book blends careful historical research with rich personal reflections.

Goldman, author of <i>The American Soul Rush</i><br><br>&#x201c;This remarkable book deserves the widest readership it can get, for more clearly than any other book I know it shows the depth to which the human spirit can descend and still rebound. Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard were close friends and my most important mentors, and I spent one memorable afternoon with Bill Wilson. Don Lattin's astonishing book brings their life stories alive. It is carefully researched and disarmingly honest.&#x201d;&#x2015;Huston Smith, author of <i>The World&#x2019;s Religions</i><br><br>"The painful journey from addiction, to relapse, to recovery has become the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> of our era.

There is some irony in the fact that Don Lattin was doing drugs and drinking heavily while reporting on religion for the San Francisco Chronicle.

Rather than tell you all about sail trim or anchoring in a single chapter, Robby Robinson tells you what you need to know when you want to know it. From the absolute basics to the most advanced techniques, the <i>International Marine Book of Sailing</i> is highly accessible--and informative--at every level.</p> <ul><li>More than 500 pages and 1,000 color photos and illustrations. </li><li>Covers everything from high-performance and Olympic-class sailing dinghies to coastal and offshore cruising sailboats. No matter your age or the kind of sailing you'd most like to do, this book will work for you. </li><li>The easy-flowing instructional text is augmented by sidebar features giving alternative approaches, definitions of terms, and boat-to-boat variations--a uniquely effective how-to combination. </li><li>Includes contributions from Nigel Calder (<i>Boatowner's Mechanical and Electrical Manual</i>), Beth Leonard (<i>The Voyager's Handbook</i>), Robert Perry (<i>Yacht Design According to Perry</i>), Bob Sweet (<i>The Weekend Navigator</i>), Charlie Wing (<i>How Boat Things Work</i>), and other top sailing writers. </li><li>Renders sailing and seamanship more transparent and accessible than ever before. </li><li>The ideal book for self-teaching.</li></ul></p><p><p><b>Robby Robinson</b> is a former SAIL magazine editor, America's Cup challenger, sailing instructor and English teacher. He is coauthor of two books, <i>Night and Fog</i> and <i>Sailors' Secrets</i>.</p><p>There may be other sailing instructional books, but there are none like this! Not only is this one the largest--with more than 500 pages and 1,000 color photos and illustrations--but it is painstakingly written and designed to accompany you along the ideal learning curve for sailors. </p><p>In Chapter 1 Robby Robinson gets you sailing in a single afternoon using just the mainsail and basic sail trim while you learn to judge the wind and your course. In later chapters he introduces the jib and other sails along with progressively more subtle sail-shaping adjustments, until you know enough to win races or cross an ocean. </p><p>Similarly, you'll find the basics of anchoring, knot tying, piloting, and seamanship early in the book and more advanced techniques as they become relevant later on. This progressive mode of organization is intuitively easy to use, but <i>The International Marine Book of Sailing</i> is the only book designed this way. Other books organize content by topic, giving you, for example, everything about sail trim in a single chapter. The result is too much detail too soon for beginners, while experienced sailors must wade through things they already know in order to find what they don't. A sailing instructor since he was a teenager, Robinson knows what you need to know when. Editor, author, and seamanship source, he knows how to help you continue honing your skills. </p><p>And this is a sailing book with a sailor's heart. Robinson reaches deep into his well of experience to share definitions, variations, and alternatives in the book's generous sidebars. The result is a richly informative how-to mix of technology and technique, lively anecdote and sailing tradition--all thoroughly cross-referenced so you can easily find more advanced or basic details on the subject at hand.</p><p>The hundreds of photos shot especially for the book help take you from one-design sloops to high-performance racing dinghies and sturdy offshore cruising vessels. The book's vision of sailing is wide-ranging and democratic. Robinson has cruised Europe and the U.S. East Coast with his wife and children in his simple 25-footer and has chartered bigger boats all over the world, cruised multihulls as well as monohulls, and raced dinghies as well as keelboats. In <i>The International Marine Book of Sailing</i> he distills the lessons of a lifetime into a book organized to make them readily available and powerfully clear.</p><p>But it's Robinson's ability to turn a phrase that makes this book such a delight and his lessons so memorable. He gently reminds us, for example, that "no matter how peaceful your time on the water, you are never that far from being in the water." And he punctuates his advice for choosing the right cruising boat with the disclaimer that "applying someone else's standards is like chasing someone else's dream. Find out what matters to you, and use your own standards to chart you own course."</p><p>In <i>The International Marine Book of Sailing</i>, Robby Robinson has charted a new course for sailing books.</p></p><h2>Accounting: What the Numbers Mean</h2><p>Accounting has become known as the language of business.

In the early 1990s, just prior to his immersion in the scene around New York's Alleged Gallery, Campbell would regularly hole up in the North African enclave to produce paintings for solo exhibitions in Paris, New York and Rabat, all the while scouring the coast during the winter months for whatever waves might roll in from the Atlantic. Later, over the last ten years, Campbell brought various surfers of note (such as Dan Malloy, Alex Knost, Craig Anderson, Dave Rastovich and Ryan Burch) to join him there, and to savor Morocco's glorious climate and stupendous surf. This book, the second in Campbell's <i>Slide</i> surfing series (following 2012's <i>Slide Your Brains Out</i>), records these collective Moroccan adventures from the past 20 years, in color and black-and-white images that range from the everyday to the sublime.</p><p></p><h2>Human Behavior and the Social Environment: Theory and Practice</h2><p><p>This comprehensive text integrates multiple dimensions of the human experience in a reader-friendly style and provides the interface between developmental theory and practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Human Behavior and the Social Environment, 1/e, </i>introduces and incorporates current research on the biological, psychological, socio-cultural, and spiritual dimensions of human behavior throughout the life-cycle.

The reason is not simply that he converted to Christianity, but that he did so in a way that brought his subjects along after him. Indeed, this major new biography argues that Constantine's conversion is but one feature of a unique administrative style that enabled him to take control of an empire beset by internal rebellions and external threats by Persians and Goths. The vast record of Constantine's administration reveals a government careful in its exercise of power but capable of ruthless, even savage, actions. Constantine executed (or drove to suicide) his father-in-law, two brothers-in-law, his eldest son, and his once beloved wife. An unparalleled general throughout his life, planning a major assault on the Sassanian Empire in Persia even on his deathbed. Alongside the visionary who believed that his success came from the direct intervention of his God resided an aggressive warrior, a sometimes cruel partner, and an immensely shrewd ruler. These characteristics combined together in a long and remarkable career, which restored the Roman Empire to its former glory. <br><br>Beginning with his first biographer Eusebius, Constantine's image has been subject to distortion. More recent revisions include John Carroll's view of him as the intellectual ancestor of the Holocaust (<em>Constantine's Sword</em>) and Dan Brown's presentation of him as the man who oversaw the reshaping of Christian history (<em>The Da Vinci Code</em>). In Constantine the Emperor, David Potter confronts each of these skewed and partial accounts to provide the most comprehensive, authoritative, and readable account of Constantine's extraordinary life.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Potter</strong> is Francis W.

Why do we suffer? Why do people die young? Is there any point to our pain, physical or emotional? Do horrors like hurricanes have meaning?<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Seven Ways of Looking at Pointless Suffering</i>, Scott Samuelson tackles that hardest question of all. To do so, he travels through the history of philosophy and religion, but he also attends closely to the real world we live in. While always taking the question of suffering seriously, Samuelson is just as likely to draw lessons from Bugs Bunny as from Confucius, from his time teaching philosophy to prisoners as from Hannah Arendt&#x2019;s attempts to come to terms with the Holocaust. He guides us through the arguments people have offered to answer this fundamental question, explores the many ways that we have tried to minimize or eliminate suffering, and examines people&#x2019;s attempts to find ways to live with pointless suffering. Ultimately, Samuelson shows, to be fully human means to acknowledge a mysterious paradox: we must simultaneously accept suffering and oppose it. And understanding that is itself a step towards acceptance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wholly accessible, and thoroughly thought-provoking, <i>Seven Ways of Looking at Pointless Suffering</i> is a masterpiece of philosophy, returning the field to its roots&#x2014;helping us see new ways to understand, explain, and live in our world, fully alive to both its light and its darkness.</p><p><b>Scott Samuelson </b>lives in Iowa City, Iowa, where he teaches philosophy at Kirkwood Community College and is a movie reviewer, television host, and sous-chef at a French restaurant on a gravel road.&nbsp;Visit the author's website:&nbsp;http://scottsamuelsonauthor.com/"Excellent. . . . The challenge that Samuelson locates in the philosophical tradition, and which he passes on to the reader, is to reflect deeply on what it means to live with pointless suffering while resisting the temptation to transmute it into meaningful pain, which is something else entirely. . . One of the many virtues of Samuelson's book is that the reader often feels as though she were his student. His wry, self-deprecating and confessional style is both serious and playful--and seriously playful. The exposition of different philosophers and traditions is careful and scholarly without being pedantic. . . . Another great merit of Samuelson's insightful, informative and deeply humane book is that it is a genuine pleasure to read. Herein lies a final challenge to the reader: after luxuriating in his reflections, we must close the book and return to daily life with renewed determination and courage to apply its lessons."<br><br> &nbsp; (<i>Times Higher Education, Book of the Week</i>)<br><br>"You can keep your gratitude journals, but make no mistake about it: this world is a vale of tears, a world of seemingly senseless suffering. How we understand and relate ourselves to this suffering will shape our lives both morally and otherwise. A gifted author with a feathery writing touch on the weightiest of subjects, Scott Samuelson has succeeded in carefully distilling the wisdom of a wide array of philosophers on what St. Paul called 'the groaning of creation.' Rife with engaging personal stories, Samuelson's meditation is both intellectually substantive and uplifting." (Gordon Marino, author of The Existential Survival Guide)<br><br>"In this eminently&nbsp;readable but subtle book, Scott Samuelson opens up new ways of thinking about suffering.&nbsp;Weaving together philosophical reflections with compelling stories of his time teaching in prison, Samuelson shows us the various roles undeserved suffering plays our lives, and indeed in&nbsp;life itself.&nbsp;This book is a necessary read for those of us who want to reflect on the place of pain in human existence."

It is clear, thorough and judicious; in short, magnificent."--<em>The Economist</em> "...Gaddis has done a thorough job of collating material from these diverse sources...and constructing a trenchant analysis that puts these fascinating tidbits into context."--<em>San Francisco Chronicle &amp; Examiner</em> Based on the latest findings of Cold War historians and extensive research in American archives as well as the recently opened archives in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and China, <em>We Now Know</em> provides a vividly written, eye-opening account of the Cold War during the years from the end of World War II to the Cuban missile crisis. The book brims with new information drawn from previously unavailable sources, with fresh insight into the impact of ideology, economics, and nuclear weapons, and with striking reinterpretations of the roles of Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Khrushchev, Mao, and Stalin. Indeed, Gaddis concludes that if there was one factor that made the Cold War unavoidable it was Stalin.</p><p>Was the Cold War inevitable? Was there an international communist conspiracy? Did Castro and Khrushchev beat Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis? After combing through a mass of declassified and previously unavailable documentation to reconsider the collision of the American and Soviet empires, Yale professor Gaddis replies in the affirmative. Given Josef Stalin&#39;s convictions, the Cold War was inescapable: it is the choices that each side made that prove fruitful for historical research, and not the mere fact of the war, as Gaddis neatly demonstrates. The American empire--Gaddis&#39;s term--prevailed because, he says, &#34;democracy proved superior to autocracy in maintaining coalitions,&#34; and not necessarily because of any technological or economic advantage. Gaddis dispels several misconceptions and urges that students of Cold War history should foremost &#34;retain the capacity to be surprised.&#34;<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>John Lewis Gaddis</strong> will become Robert Lovett Professor of History at Yale University in the Autumn of 1997.

G. Jung (1875&#x2013;1961) was a preeminent thinker of the modern era. In seeking to establish an interdisciplinary science of analytical psychology, he studied psychiatry, religion, mysticism, literature, physics, biology, education, and criminology. He introduced the concepts of extraversion and introversion, and terms such as complex, archetype, individuation, and the collective unconscious. He stressed the primacy of finding meaning in our lives.</p><p><i>The Quotable Jung</i> is the single most comprehensive collection of Jung quotations ever assembled. It is the essential introduction for anyone new to Jung and the Jungian tradition.

Organized thematically, this collection covers such topics as the psyche, the symbolic life, dreams, the analytic process, good and evil, creativity, alchemical transformation, death and rebirth, the problem of the opposites, and more. The quotations are arranged so that the reader can follow the thread of Jung&#x2019;s thought on these topics while gaining an invaluable perspective on his writings as a whole.</p><p>Succinct and accessible, <i>The Quotable Jung</i> also features a preface by Judith Harris and a detailed chronology of Jung&#x2019;s life and work.<br></p><ul><li>The single most comprehensive collection of Jung quotations ever assembled</li><li>Features hundreds of quotes</li><li>Covers such topics as the psyche, dreams, good and evil, death and rebirth, and more</li><li>Includes a detailed chronology of Jung&#x2019;s life and work</li><li>Serves as the ideal introduction to Jung and the Jungian tradition</li></ul><p></p></p><p><p>"An ideal resource for anyone seeking to find Jung's most fertile ideas succinctly and powerfully stated."<b>--John Beebe, author of <i>Integrity in Depth</i></b></p><p>"This comprehensive selection of quotations provides a pathway into the complex world of Jung's thought while never reducing his ideas to oversimplified formulas. <i>The Quotable Jung</i> is an extremely useful volume for anyone coming to Jung for the first time."<b>--Paul Bishop, author of <i>Reading Goethe at Midlife: Ancient Wisdom, German Classicism, and Jung</i></b></p><p>"Brings all of Jung's ideas together in brilliant form. . . .

He is the author of <i>Junk Drawer Physics</i>, <i>Junk Drawer Chemistry</i>, and <i>The Flying Machine Book</i>.<br>Gr 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;As the title suggests, most of the tasks described in this volume require readily available or recycled materials. The projects range in complexity from old-fashioned cup-and-string phones to "secret computer monitors" that demonstrate polarized light. They are divided into three general categories: energy (which features a variety of roller-coaster challenges), structures (buildings designed to hold a certain amount of weight), and waves (experiments with light and sound). Each project is presented with step-by-step instructions and illustrated with black-and-white photos, followed by an explanation of the science involved and ways to adapt the activity for different age groups. The strength of the text lies in the simple but clear descriptions of the science behind each challenge. Tips on how to extend or simplify each project for different ages are interesting and useful, too, although the author often proposes having middle and high school students "do the math" or calculate the forces involved, sometimes without providing much additional assistance. Readers without a background in physics may need to consult other sources. In addition, the projects are presented one after the other, with new ones often starting in the middle of a page, which makes the book harder to browse.

The event featured a series of seminal papers, from Deleuze's first presentation of the concept of the &#x201c;rhizome&#x201d; to Foucault's introduction of his <i>History of Sexuality</i> project. The conference was equally important on a political level, and brought together a diverse group of activists, thinkers, patients, and ex-cons in order to address the challenge of penal and psychiatric institutions. The combination proved to be explosive, but amid the fighting and confusion &#x201c;Schizo-Culture&#x201d; revealed deep ruptures in left politics, French thought, and American culture.</p><p>The &#x201c;Schizo-Culture&#x201d; issue of the Semiotext(e) journal came three years later.

We all encounter probability problems in our everyday lives. In this collection of twenty-one puzzles, Paul Nahin challenges us to think creatively about the laws of probability as they apply in playful, sometimes deceptive, ways to a fascinating array of speculative situations. Games of Russian roulette, problems involving the accumulation of insects on flypaper, and strategies for determining the odds of the underdog winning the World Series all reveal intriguing dimensions to the workings of probability. Over the years, Nahin, a veteran writer and teacher of the subject, has collected these and other favorite puzzles designed to instruct and entertain math enthusiasts of all backgrounds.</p><br><p> If idiots A and B alternately take aim at each other with a six-shot revolver containing one bullet, what is the probability idiot A will win? What are the chances it will snow on your birthday in any given year? How can researchers use coin flipping and the laws of probability to obtain honest answers to embarrassing survey questions? The solutions are presented here in detail, and many contain a profound element of surprise. And some puzzles are beautiful illustrations of basic mathematical concepts: "The Blind Spider and the Fly," for example, is a clever variation of a "random walk" problem, and "Duelling Idiots" and "The Underdog and the World Series" are straightforward introductions to binomial distributions.</p><br><p> Written in an informal way and containing a plethora of interesting historical material, <i>Duelling Idiots</i> is ideal for those who are fascinated by mathematics and the role it plays in everyday life and in our imaginations.</p></p><p><p>"For those of us who thoroughly enjoy a good puzzle, <i>Duelling Idiots</i> is indeed a welcome book.

It emphasizes the common characteristics of the Central American states as well as their potential for political union. Now completely updated, the third edition of <em>Central America: A Nation Divided</em> encompasses the significant new research and tumultuous events that have taken place since the last edition was published. The text now includes coverage of the civil wars in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, as well as the restoration of peace to the region under the Central American peace accords. It also recounts and analyzes the substantial changes that have occurred in the economic and social arenas as Central American states have turned increasingly to neoliberal policies that emphasize the private sector and the development of exports while reducing government entitlement programs. Students will find this text enormously helpful for sorting through the vast amounts of significant research that has been written and compiled in the past decade. In addition, the Selective Guide to the Literature section has been completely revised to reflect the great increase in research and writing on Central America. Comprehensive and incisively written, <em>Central America: A Nation Divided</em> is an essential text for Latin American History courses.<br></p><p>Ralph Lee Woodward is at Tulane University."I have used this book in successive editions since it first came out.

While inspired by the sense of spiritual certainty, their narrative quality, subtle humor, and visionary power lift them far above the common run of &#34;religious&#34; literature. Moralists purport to tell us what our lives should mean, and how we should live them. Tolstoy, on the other hand, has an uncanny gift for simply conveying what it means to be truly alive.</p><p>Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), Russian author, whose classic novels include War and Peace (1863-69) and Anna Karenina (1875-77).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Romeo and Juliet (Arden Shakespeare Second)</h2><p>Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare&#39;s most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers. Romeo and Juliet is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love, since it is such an obvious subject of the play.....</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s. The series, long since out-of-print, is now reissued. Each work contains a lengthy and lively introduction, main text, and substantial notes and glossary.The magnificent, timeless drama is the world&#39;s most famous tale of &#34;star-crossed lovers.&#34; The young, unshakable love of Juliet and Romeo defies the feud that divides their families--the Capulets and Montagues--as their desperate need to be together, their secret meetings, and finally their concealed marriage drive them toward tragedy. A masterwork that has long captured the hearts of audiences, this romantic tragedy has become part of the literary heritage of all peoples in all nations.</p><h2>Volvo 850 Series 1993 thru 1997 (Haynes Manuals)</h2><p>Haynes Manuals have a new look!

Psychomagic recognizes that it is difficult to reach the unconscious with rational thought. We should instead speak directly to the unconscious in its own language, that of dreams, poetry, and symbolic acts. By interacting on this deeper level, we can initiate quicker and more enduring change to resolve repressed childhood trauma, express buried emotions, and overcome deep-seated intimacy issues. Through the lens of psychomagic, illness can be seen as the physical dream of the unconscious, revealing unresolved issues, some passed from generation to generation.<br><br>In this workbook of psychomagical spells, legendary filmmaker and creator of psychomagic Alejandro Jodorowsky provides several hundred successful psychomagic solutions for a wide range of psychological, sexual, emotional, and physical problems from stuttering, eczema, and fear of failure to repressed rage, hereditary illnesses, and domineering parents. Each solution takes the same elements associated with a negative emotional charge and recasts them into a series of theatrical symbolic actions that enable one to pay the psychological debts hindering their lives. Explaining the shamanic techniques at the foundation of psychomagic, the author offers methods for aspiring practitioners to develop solutions for their own unique patients. <br><br>Jodorowsky explains how the surreal acts of psychomagic are intended to break apart the dysfunctional persona with whom the patient identifies in order to connect with a deeper, more authentic self. As he says in the book, &#x201c;Health only finds itself in the authentic. There is no beauty without authenticity.&#x201d;</p><p>Alejandro Jodorowsky is the legendary filmmaker of <i>El Topo</i> and <i>The Holy Mountain</i>.

Now, more than a decade later, the discipline has come of age. This new volume provides a comprehensive overview of this fast-evolving field. More than a revised edition, the text reflects the dramatic impact of recent advances in neuroscience and computer technology, coupled with changes in service delivery models. The authors describe a broad range of clinical interventions for assisting persons with acquired cognitive impairments--including deficits in attention, memory, executive functions, and communication--and for managing associated emotional and behavioral issues. For each approach, theoretical underpinnings are reviewed in depth and clinical protocols delineated. Difficult concepts are explained in a clear, straightforward fashion, with realistic case examples bringing the material to life. Also included are samples of relevant assessment instruments, rating scales, and patient handouts. Throughout, the new volume emphasizes the need to work from a community perspective, providing a framework for forming collaborative partnerships with families and caregivers. It is an essential resource for professionals across a wide variety of rehabilitation specialties, and will serve as a text in courses on rehabilitation methods and neurogenic disorders.</p><p>McKay Moore Sohlberg, PhD, is a nationally recognized leader in the field of traumatic brain injury rehabilitation.

Captivated, he investigated further and learned that from 1590 to 1890, this cross between a prayer book and a farmer's almanac was immensely popular in households all across Europe. Published in dozens of editions and revised over the centuries in Venice, Prague, Amsterdam, and throughout Germany before moving eastward in the nineteenth century to Poland and Russia, these books detail the evolution of Jewish custom over three hundred years. But by the 1890s, as Jewish practice became polarized between the secularist and traditionalist views, the Minhogimbukh disappeared. </p> <p> There are no works quite like the historical customs books available today and none so thorough and concise, intuitive in organization, and beautiful. Inspired by the originals, Kosofsky set out to make his own, adapting the books for modern use, adding historical perspective and contemporary application. The result is the reappearance of the Minhogimbukh after more than a hundred-year absence, and the first complete showing of all the original woodcuts -- a visual vocabulary of Jewish life -- since the 1760s. Faithfully based on the earlier editions, <i>The Book of Customs</i> is an updated guide to the rituals, liturgies, and texts of the entire Jewish year -- from the days of the week and the Sabbath to all the months with their festivals, as well as the major life-cycle events of wedding, birth, bar and bat mitzvah, and death. With the revival of this lost cultural legacy, <i>The Book of Customs</i> can once again become every family's guide to Jewish tradition and practice. </p></p><p>In Europe from the 16th to the 19th centuries, popular "books of customs" brought Judaism down to the level of "Every Jew." These books dealt with holidays, life-cycle rituals, weekly Sabbaths and daily prayers. Written in Yiddish, they were illustrated with woodcuts that showed how to observe the rituals and liturgies that composed day-to-day Judaism. Kosofsky, who stumbled upon one of these books while an undergraduate at Harvard, adapts several such guides for modern usage here, including all of the original woodcuts. (He also reproduces the title page from a 1593 edition that promises to teach readers "how to live like a good person" and boasts its superiority to all previous versions.) Kosofsky&#x2019;s book is interesting both as a history lesson&#x2014;12 of the woodcuts depict monthly farming activities, for example, showing how agricultural Jewish life was a few centuries ago&#x2014;and a spiritual guide for modern readers. As Kosofsky demonstrates, a "book of customs" does as good a job today of "helping its readers feel comfortable and competent in the Jewish world" as it did hundreds of years ago. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Beginning in the late fourteenth century, <i>The Book of Customs</i>, a compact guide to the<i> </i>Jewish year, was published in Yiddish, the Jews' vernacular at that time in Europe. For nearly four centuries, elaborate editions were created, and it was among the most popular Jewish books in the European Diaspora until it disappeared by the end of the nineteenth century. Using the 1593 Venice edition as a model, Kosofsky added a number of discursive elements, including introductions to the book's major divisions and concepts, descriptions of all of the prayers and many of the Bible readings, a general chapter on Jewish law and custom, and one on Jewish prayer to explain how the daily prayer rituals are performed. Also added are chapters on customs and holidays that weren't mentioned, or didn't exist, in 1593, such as bar mitzvahs and the Holocaust Remembrance Day. This first English translation, as important as it is delightful, includes reproductions of many of the original woodcut illustrations that are housed in the libraries at Oxford and Harvard universities. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Ethiopia Shall Soon Stretch Out Her Hands to God." -Psalms 68:31</b><br><br>From 110th to 140th Street, Seventh Avenue on this pleasant Sunday afternoon was a grandly tumultuous parade ground. The animated crowds pushed over the jammed sidewalks into the street. Every stoop was pre-empted by eager groups of youngsters struggling to hold their places and warding off newcomers. Above, the tri-color green-yellow-red of Ethiopia blazoned from many windows. Streamers were thrown at the marchers and confetti fluttered in the air like colored moths. With bands and banners and pompous feet the procession undulated along the avenue. There were Elks and Masons and other fraternal orders, political and religious organizations, social clubs and study clubs-the Ethiopian Students Class, the African Historical Society, the Senegambian Scouts, Ladies' Auxiliaries, children's groups. At intervals resounding claps rewarded some section which attracted special attention by a piece of meretricious music or movement. Near the corner where the procession went down a side street to the church, a huge banner floated over the avenue, bearing the motto: welcome to the prince of ethiopia: envoy of his imperial majesty.<br><br>As the tail of the march trailed by, the official cars followed at a slow pace. There were three of them, each carrying the Ethiopian flag and the Stars and Stripes. In the first two cars there were the notables of Harlem; in the third the Ethiopian envoy, a slight olive-colored youth with large calf's eyes. The people applauded, clapping, whistling and shouting "God Save Ethiopia!"<br><br>But as the cars rolled down to the church, from far down the avenue came the echo of a mighty roar. The noise became tumultuous as it surged up the street. "Hey! Hey! Hey! Rey! Rey! Rey!" It was borne along by a bigger crowd escorting an open automobile in which stood a full-sized ebon-hued man, bedecked in a uniform so rare, so gorgeous, it made the people prance and shout with joy. "R-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-y!" The shouting rose to its highest point like the furious sounding of a thousand bagpipes, like a paddock full of horses wildly neighing, like the exuberant flourish of a parade of kettledrums.<br><br>The lone personage wore a mailed shirt extravagantly covered with golden gleaming arabesques and a wonderfully high shako, white and surmounted by a variegated cluster of ostrich plumes. With his right hand held at salute he smiled triumphantly, almost roguishly. Responding to the thunderous salvos of acclaim, the throng that could not be accommodated in the huge church surged up from the side street to meet the new multitude of the avenue. Thrilled by the tumultuous spectacle, suddenly the saluting dignitary unsheathed his sword and brandished it at heaven. The mass roared in a frenzy while slowly the car threaded through, turning down the side street to the church.<br><br>The people wondered. Who was the richly bedecked apparition? The ignorant said it was the prince envoy. But others more informed said the envoy had already passed and entered the church with the notables. It was the military aide of the envoy, someone suggested, and the gossip rustled like a wind-blown leaf from mouth to mouth.<br><br>Inside the immense church the vast audience was startled by the tremendous uproar. The choir had sung the Ethiopian anthem, and stirred by the tumult, which penetrated and filled the church, the audience was restless. Up on the platform sat the dignitaries with the young envoy in the midst of them. They were whispering to one another about the cause of the heightened prolonged cheering, when suddenly they were amazed by the dramatic entrance of the man in uniform. The audience turned and saw him like a medieval knight framed in the portal and it rose with one accord and cheered. The envoy in formal clothes distinguished only by a red slash aslant his breast had not elicited anything approaching this warm welcome extended to the military personage.<br><br>The chairman of the meeting thought at once that the uninvited notable could not be left unnoticed there among the audience. Besides, he stood there smiling, saluting as if waiting for official recognition. So after hurriedly whispering with a colleague, the chairman dispatched the chief usher to bring the soldier to the platform. Applause pursued him as he marched elegantly, deliberately down the aisle and ascended the platform. There he saluted and bowed to the audience, shook hands with the chairman and took the introduction to the envoy with a deferential bow.<br><br>"Professor Koazhy!" The envoy repeated the name in a low tone, his wide eyes in wonder surveying the uniform. So he was not really a military man, but had thus adorned himself in honor of the occasion, the envoy thought. But he had pleased the crowds, and had been rewarded with an ovation greater than was given to him, the official representative of Ethiopia. Perhaps he too should have worn a uniform, as Pablo Peixota, the chairman, had suggested. But he did not like uniforms and rarely wore one, unless he was attending a state function, and nothing he might have worn could compare with the resplendent splendor of Professor Koazhy's accoutrement. But why did Professor Koazhy choose to wear this barbaric fantastic costume, which was not symbolic of the new spirit of Ethiopia? And how puzzling that that uniform had made such a powerful appeal to the senses of the crowd. For these people were not anything like the tribal Ethiopians, the envoy thought; they were more like European crowds. From the quaint and fanciful accounts he had read, from things he had heard, he had imagined a very different kind of people. These Aframericans-<br><br>Meanwhile, Chairman Pablo Peixota was calling the great meeting to order. He spoke through a megaphone. Briefly he said that the purpose of the meeting was firstly to give aid to Ethiopia and secondly to welcome the representative of the Emperor. He said Ethiopia was a Holy Land to all Aframericans, that afternoon's glorious demonstration was a proof of their interest. Ethiopia was the ancient lamp of Africa, which should not be extinguished. The Aframerican people had pledged themselves to help keep that lamp burning. They were collecting the funds and sending medical aid. The Emperor of Ethiopia had condescended to send a representative as a token of his goodwill and to give encouragement and inspiration to the efforts of the Aframericans. "Let us show to him the things that we can do and will do. Let us begin in a big way this afternoon."<br><br>The chairman spoke efficiently but not brilliantly. He was precise, as if he were reading from a manuscript. Next he called upon the minister of the church, the Reverend Zebulon Trawl, to say a prayer for Ethiopia. The minister was of about the same complexion as the envoy, but more heavily built. He prayed rhythmically for Ethiopia, the Emperor and his family, his advisers, his generals and the armies, the confounding of their enemies, the restoration of peace to the land. And lastly he prayed for Aframericans, dropping down to a colloquial and dithyrambic note: "Get busy and do your stuff, brothers and sisters. Begin today, start right now, put your hands in your pockets and not for nothing, bring it up, bring it out, get under your pillow, open the jars in your cupboards, open up the old family Bible where you have some bills pressed down like faded flowers, pennies and nickels and dimes, bring them in for the defense of Ethiopia. The Emperor has honored us here in America, sending to us his personal personable representative." He turned to the envoy. "Never before have our people been honored in such a grand manner. Let us show ourselves worthy of that honor. Mohammed he went to the mountain, and Ethiopia has come to us, to you and to me, to each one of us. Oh, my brothers and sisters, Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hands to God."<br><br>Many voices responded: "God, God! Amen, Amen!"<br><br>The chairman said he would ask each speaker to be brief, as the long parade had delayed the beginning of the meeting. There were seven speakers besides the envoy: another outstanding preacher, a prominent doctor, a high official of a popular fraternal order, a leader of the Back-to-Africa movement, a university professor, a woman representing the Colored Women's Clubs and a representative of the White Friends of Ethiopia.<br><br>At last the young envoy, Lij Tekla Alamaya, was announced. He stepped nimbly forward, bowing to the chairman and the other speakers, and was greeted with prolonged cheering. He thanked the people for the warm welcome they had extended to him, as a representative of the Emperor and the people of Ethiopia. He stressed the gratitude of the Ethiopians for Aframerican sympathy and help. He told of the valor of the armies in the field, but that they were fighting a modern war without modern arms. They needed artillery and machine guns, warplanes and armored trucks, uniforms and shoes, medical supplies and doctors and nurses.<br><br>He described Ethiopia as a land-locked nation unable to communicate with the outside world, except across the territory of hostile or inhospitable nations. But nevertheless the people were courageous and brave as ever, jealous of their great traditions and guarding their ancient faith, the same Christian faith of Aframericans, which had inspired them to rise up and demonstrate to defend Ethiopia as they had today. "I am nothing but the humble servant of my Emperor who has sent me to you in the name of his people. I have come to give you all the information you require about Ethiopia, the Emperor and the Imperial Family and the Imperial Army. Things that are strange and incomprehensible to you, I shall endeavor to make clear. We thank you from our hearts for all the help that you have extended to us. Oh, we need all the help that you have pledged and much more, for the enemy is strong and cunning. My Emperor sent me to you as his humble servant and now I am also your humble servant."<br><br>Lij Alamaya won a fine ovation. The sympathy of the audience was touched by his slight appealing figure and his rather quaint English which sounded as if he had learned most of it in school in a foreign country. But as the applause died down there were shouts of "Professor Koazhy! Professor Koazhy!" "Let's hear Professor Koazhy." The entire audience voiced the demand and waited expectantly.<br><br>The chairman could not do less than present the gentleman in his uniformed splendor. And the roar of applause that exploded when he stood up was visibly disconcerting to the notables on the platform. It was greater than they all had received, including the envoy, and it was not funny.<br><br>Proudly stepping forward amidst the wild plaudits of the audience, and posing erectly-elated to be so signally honored, although he had not been one of the notables invited to participate-he was a perfect picture of triumph. Who else could have conceived and executed his inimitable performance?<br><br>Professor Koazhy clicked his heels, saluted, paid his respect to Lij Alamaya and the chairman and spoke in a deep kind of preacher's voice. "Some of you here know who I am," he declared, "but I know that the majority are applauding this uniform. That is as it should be. For I did not wear this uniform for merely a gaudy show. I put it on for a purpose-a special purpose. This is the uniform of an Ethiopian warrior. I went through all the trouble and expense of procuring it so that you should have a dramatic idea of why you are gathered here. In this uniform I want you not to see me, but the great warriors of Ethiopia. A long line of them who have fought and died so that their nation should live.<br><br>"Oh, my friends, this is a grand event. And it is a wonderful opportunity for me. Here in your midst in flesh and blood you have an Ethiopian-a Prince of Africa. I pray you, I implore you to realize the significance of it. I have given many years to the study and teaching of African history. The newspapers and the professors mocked me. Yet I am a college man and as good a professor as any of them. It was because I didn't study and teach African history the way they do it in the classrooms. I gave it to those who were hungry for it, the people who came and sat right down at my feet to get it. They said I was funny in the head, that I had an obsession, because I said that African history was as noble and great as European history. To them African history was just an unimportant chip off of European history.<br><br>"But I tell you, my friends, excited and exalted now about Ethiopia, if you knew African history, you would be better equipped to help Ethiopia. How many of you know anything about the real Ethiopia? I tell you, you are ignorant and not only you but the world is ignorant. I have just heard these learned speakers inform you that the kings of Ethiopia are descended from Solomon. I am sorry to correct them, but that is not true, my friends. The dynasty of Ethiopia is older than Solomon; it is older than the Bible.<br><br>"I must humbly apologise to our envoy and prince, but even the Ethiopians themselves today do not know their great history. They imagine that their Emperor is the Lion of Judah because he was descended from the Queen of Sheba. But that is history turned upside down. The Emperor of Ethiopia is the Lion of Judah because many centuries ago the Empire of Ethiopia extended to Egypt across Judea into Persia and India. You must know the truth and Professor Koazhy is here to teach you.<br><br>"You complain and whine about the white man's attitude towards you. I will forgive the white man for all the wrong he has done the black. I will forgive him because the white man has done one good and great thing. The white man has given the black man knowledge, and that is the greatest gift that one man can give another. Take that knowledge and learn from it. Learn about the past as it relates to you and use it to do something about the present. What you should know about yourself is the white man's gift to you. They wrote the truth but they cannot open your blind eyes to see it or make your minds understand. Herodotus, Volney, Champollion, Moret, Budge, Littmann, Frobenius, and a hundred more.<br><br>"What you all should know is also what the Ethiopians should know about themselves. Then they will fight better and you will help more." Professor Koazhy unsheathed the sword and held it up and said: "A sword in the hands of an ignorant man is a dangerous weapon that may destroy him. Knowledge is available. Get it. Learn, learn, and learn more."</p><h2>The Honorary Consul.</h2><p>In The Honorary Consul, a British consul with a fondness for drink is mistaken for an American ambassador and kidnapped by Paraguayan revolutionaries.</p><p><p>"The tension never relaxes and one reads hungrily from page to page, reading the moment it will end." - Auberon Waugh, Evening Standard</p><b>Graham Greene </b>(1904-1991), whose long life nearly spanned the length of the twentieth century, was one of its greatest novelists. Educated at Berkhamsted School and Balliol College, Oxford, he started his career as a sub-editor of <i>The Times of London. </i>He began to attract notice as a novelist with his fourth book, <i>Orient Express, </i>in 1932. In 1935, he trekked across northern Liberia, his first experience in Africa, recounted in <i>A Journey Without Maps </i>(1936). He converted to Catholicism in 1926, an edifying decision, and reported on religious persecution in Mexico in 1938 in <i>The Lawless Roads, </i>which served as a background for his famous <i>The Power and the Glory</i>, one of several &#x201c;Catholic&#x201d; novels (<i>Brighton Rock, The Heart of the Matter, The End of the Affair). </i>During the war he worked for the British secret service in Sierra Leone; afterward, he began wide-ranging travels as a journalist, which were reflected in novels such as <i>The Quiet American, Our Man in Havana, The Comedians, Travels with My Aunt, The Honorary Consul, The Human Factor, Monsignor Quixote, </i>and <i>The Captain and the Enemy. </i>In addition to his many novels, Graham Greene wrote several collections of short stories, four travel books, six plays, two books of autobiography&#x2014;<i>A Sort of Life </i>and <i>Ways of Escape</i>&#x2014;two biographies, and four books for children. He also contributed hundreds of essays and film and book reviews to <i>The Spectator </i>and other journals, many of which appear in the late collection <i>Reflections. </i>Most of his novels have been filmed, including <i>The Third Man</i>, which the author first wrote as a film treatment.

Only better, because its essays represent points of view all along the intervening spectrum, but have in common a desire for the information offered to incite a beneficial outcome. This is no weary recital of preservation lore, but a call to consider an informed action.

Houle World Award for Literature in Adult Education<br> <br> "[Brookfield] gently demystifies critically reflective learning and teaching with dozens of practical examples from the classroom in different scholarly fields. Lucid, wise, jargon-free, personal and fluently written. Required reading for educators of adults everywhere and for all faculty development programs."<br> -- Jack Mezirow, emeritus professor of adult education, Teachers College, Columbia University<br> <br> Building on the insights of his highly acclaimed earlier work, The Skillful Teacher, and applying the principles of adult learning, Brookfield thoughtfully guides teachers through the processes of becoming critically reflective about teaching, confronting the contradictions involved in creating democratic classrooms, and using critical reflection as a tool for ongoing personal and professional development.</p><p>Building on the insights of his highly acclaimed earlier work, The Skillful Teacher, Stephen D. Brookfield offers a very personal and accessible guide to how faculty at any level and across all disciplines can improve their teaching. Applying the principles of adult learning, Brookfield thoughtfully guides teachers through the processes of becoming critically reflective about teaching, confronting the contradictions involved in creating democratic classrooms and using critical reflection as a tool for ongoing personal and professional development.Using numerous examples, Brookfield describes what critical reflection is and why it is so important. He tells how teachers can reframe their teaching by viewing their practice through four distinctive lenses: their autobiographies as teachers and learners, their students&#39; eyes, their colleagues&#39; perceptions, and theoretical literature. He includes specific advice on using practical approaches to critical reflection such as teaching diaries, role model profiles, participant learning portfolios, structured critical conversation. the Critical Incident Classroom Questionnaire, the Good Practices Audit, and more. He explains how the literature of educational research and philosophy can be used as an aid to, rather than an inhibitor of, critical reflection. And he discusses how to create a campus culture that supports critically reflective teaching.STEPHEN D. BROOKFIELD is Distinguished Professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. He has written widely on the topics of adult education, critical thinking, and teaching and has received numerous awards for his books, including the Cyril O.

Taken together, his musings, reflections, and sallies amount to a subtle and implicit theory of how cultural objects fall through time and circumstance and often deliver unintended consequences, both in the present and in the future.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Real Life Rock</i> reveals the critic in full: direct, erudite, funny, fierce, vivid, uninhibited, and possessing an unerring instinct for art and fraud.

Drawing from the Bible, the Pseudepigrapha, the Talmud and Midrash, the kabbalistic literature, medieval folklore, Hasidic texts, and oral lore collected in the modern era, Schwartz has gathered together nearly 700 of the key Jewish myths. The myths themselves are marvelous. We read of Adams diamond and the Land of Eretz (where it is always dark), the fall of Lucifer and the quarrel of the sun and the moon, the Treasury of Souls and the Divine Chariot. We discover new tales about the great figures of the Hebrew Bible, from Adam to Moses; stories about God's Bride, the <em>Shekhinah</em>, and the evil temptress, Lilith; plus many tales about angels and demons, spirits and vampires, giant beasts and the Golem. Equally important, Schwartz provides a wealth of additional information. For each myth, he includes extensive commentary, revealing the source of the myth and explaining how it relates to other Jewish myths as well as to world literature (for instance, comparing Eves release of evil into the world with Pandoras). For ease of use, Schwartz divides the volume into ten books, Myths of God, Myths of Creation, Myths of Heaven, Myths of Hell, Myths of the Holy Word, Myths of the Holy Time, Myths of the Holy People, Myths of the Holy Land, Myths of Exile, and Myths of the Messiah.<br></p><p><br><strong>Howard Schwartz</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. He is the editor of <em>Elijah's Violin &amp; Other Jewish Fairy Tales, Miriam's Tambourine: Jewish Folktales from Around the World, Lilith's Cave: Jewish Tales of the Supernatural</em>, and <em>Gabriel's Palace: Jewish Mystical Tales.</em> <strong>Caren Loebel-Fried</strong> is an award-winning illustrator and author of many works on mythology. Her <em>Hawaiian Legends of the Guardian Spirits</em> received the 2003 Ka Palapala Po`okela Award for Excellence in Illustration.<br><br>"This remarkable work will be of interest to both the scholar and the browser."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"One of those few books that can be cherished and enjoyed by all readers, whether scholars or merely those interested in good stories.... In this massive work, Schwartz gathers nearly seven hundred myths to show that there is, indeed, a Jewish mythology. His selections are wisely and cleverly chosen.... No one in recent times has even attempted to put together such a comprehensive work. In both the collecting and organizing of his material, Schwartz has done a masterful job."--Josepha Sherman, <em>Parabola</em><p></p><br>"Howard Schwartz offers a resounding rebuttal to the old accusation that the Jews have no mythology: hundreds of myths, in an unbroken line from the Tanakh itself to many new, previously untranslated contemporary retellings from the Middle East and throughout the diaspora. <em>Tree of Souls</em> illuminates the mythic elements of stories previously seen as theological or folkloric. Now properly classified as world mythology, they will for the first time be more accurately compared and contrasted with the foundational myths of other cultures. This is that rare book that is both a fascinating read for the non-specialist and a turning point for scholarship." --Wendy Doniger, author of <em>The Woman Who Pretended to Be Who She Was: Myths of Self-Imitation</em><p></p><br>"Beyond any of his other books, in <em>Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism</em> Howard Schwartz offers us his masterwork. If only Joseph Campbell had lived to see it. Schwartz has brought the underground streams of Midrash to the surface for the delight and edification of his academic as well as his popular readers." --Rabbi Zalman M. Schachter-Shalomi, author of <em>Wrapped in a Holy Flame: Teachings and Tales of the Hasidic Masters</em><p></p><br>"Under the complex, meaning-rich, and culturally important heading of 'mythology,' Howard Schwartz provides a beautifully introduced and annotated collection of essential stories and scenes that help to define Judaism in the classical tradition. Schwartz's careful, erudite method of presentation and his excellent selection of texts reveals fine mastery of the material and the pleasingly comparative orientation of the folklorist." --Susan Niditch, author of <em>Ancient Israelite Religion</em><p></p><br>"<em>Tree of Souls</em> promises to shatter the myth that Judaism is mythless. Drawing on primary source texts of the Jewish tradition itself, storyteller Howard Schwartz introduces us to a dimension of this ancient path that has for centuries been overshadowed by attempts at religious correctness and party-line theology. Jewish mythology, Schwartz demonstrates with ample commentaries, is not only a fact, it is the very kernel out of which grew the deepest of Kabbalistic mystery wisdom as well as the most pragmatic of Jewish law and lore. Clearly, Judaism owes its survival to its mythology, and in <em>Tree of Souls</em> Schwartz invites us to discover the mystique, actually the very life force, of this very ancient religion." --Gershon Winkler, author of <em>Magic of the Ordinary: Recovering the Shamanic in Judaism</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Tragedy of Julius Caesar (New Kittredge Shakespeare)</h2><p>George Lyman Kittredge&#x2019;s insightful editions of Shakespeare have endured in part because of his eclecticism, his diversity of interests, and his wide-ranging accomplishments, all of which are reflected in the valuable notes in each volume. <p> </p><p>These new editions have specific emphasis on the performance histories of the plays (on stage and screen). </p><p> </p><p>Features of each edition include: </p><p>- The original introduction to the Kittredge Edition </p><p>- Editor&#x2019;s Introduction to the Focus Edition.

Calling on a line or phrase from fellow poets, Ali salutes those known and loved&#x2015;W. S. Merwin, Mark Strand, James Tate, and more&#x2015;while in other searingly honest verse he courageously faces his own mortality.</p><p>Agha Shahid Ali (1949-2001) taught at the University of Utah, at the MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College, and at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.Kashmiri-American poet Ali, who died of brain cancer in 2001, made a project of bringing the ghazal further into English, inviting American poets to contribute to the anthology Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English. These 34 of Ali's own ghazals respect the traditional exigencies of the form: semi-autonomous couplets, unified by a strict scheme of repetition and rhyme. He evokes writers as various as Lorca, Sappho, Darwish and Amichai-"I too, O Amichai, saw the dresses of beautiful women./ And everything else, just like you, in Death, Hebrew, and Arabic." He is comfortable with a supplicating lyric voice, but explicitly distances himself from its traditional religious overtones ("When even God is dead, what is left but prayer?") and from its imposed gravity: "White men across the U.S. love their wives' curries-/ I say O No! to the turmeric of it all." Many of Ali's ghazals reflect the fears and questions of a man confronting death, and the book can be read as a series of poignant addresses to friends (including James Tate, Mark Strand, Dara Weir and other U.S. poets) and elegies for the self. "If you leave who will prove that my cry existed?/ Tell me what was I like before I existed." Significantly better than Rooms Are Never Finished, the NBA finalist released around the time of Ali's death, this book is an engaged testament to a surrender to form. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Food Science, An Ecological Approach</h2><p>A textbook at the forefront of a global movement toward sustainability<br><br>Food Science, An Ecological Approach presents food science and food preparation in the context of current environmental world conditions.

It is difficult to introduce a difficult author, and Mark Poster has done a brilliant job. He has selected wisely from Baudrillard� s writings. . . . More important, Poster has written what may be, pound for pound, the best introduction to a social theorist I have read. . . . Poster has somehow said everything the uninitiated needs to know before deciding to read Baudrillard.� <i>Contemporary Sociology</i><br><br> Following the lead of thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Deleuze, Baudrillard engages in a task of pointing <i>away</i> from any traditional sociological themes. His writings demand that one turn away from convenient or customary interpretations of society and, in the process, one is forced to use his or her imagination in new ways.� <i>Choice</i><br><br> Poster� s Introduction presents what is probably as clear and intelligent an exposition of Baudrillard� s ideas as you� ll find anywhere.� <i>Philosophy and Literature</i><br><br></p><p>This product is not a traditionally bound book.

Desperate to recoup her losses, she joins Dr. Larence Digby in his search for the legendary lost city of Cibola, rumored to be rich in gold. Emmaline was used to getting her own way, but Larence was not about to give up control of his expedition to a woman. Somehow, in a world of enchantment, each would have to learn to believe -- to trust the other with their lives, their secrets, and their hearts . . .</p><p>It&#39;s always a pleasure to introduce a new writer to the consumer, especially when it is a well-written romance. This second novel from Kristin Hannah proved to us she was definitely someone to watch, so we grabbed the opportunity to really promot and build her. I particularly liked this book because of its unusual hero. Lisa Congelosi, Sales RepEmmaline Amanda Hatter (the "Mad Hatter of Wall Street") and Dr. sp ok/pk Larence Digby are damaged goods. Both were orphaned young; the former was thrown on her own devices, which she parlayed into a vast fortune on Wall Street, while the latter, tormented by a crippled ankle and memories of an unsympathetic grandmother, became a fanciful professor at Columbia University. In 1893, the two meet in New York City when Emmaline funds Larence's pk expedition to the lost Aztec city of Cibola. They eventually become intimate when Emmaline is wiped out by the Wall Street crash and follows Larence to New Mexico in an attempt to get her money back or at the very least to insure her percentage of the expedition's spoils. Hannah ( A Handful of Heaven ) offers witty banter in the first half of the book; later, however, she resorts to broadcasting revelations that would be better left implied. As they draw closer to the magical Cibola, with its equally magical tubers and guardians, Larence and Emmaline learn that it's " okay to be afraid ,"stet itals to " laugh ," to be " together ," to trust, love, etc. If you wanted to know what would happen if Carlos Castaneda and Melody Beattie collaborated on a romance, here's your chance. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>You Can&#39;t Come to My Birthday Party!

Why did this respectable historian become a thief? And why did librarians in the United States and Israel accept these materials from him, turning a blind eye to the signs of ownership they bore? <br><br>With her award-winning book, <em>The Archive Thief</em>, Lisa Moses Leff reconstructs Szajkowski's gripping story in all its ambiguity. Born into poverty in Russian Poland in 1911, Szajkowski was a self-made man who managed to make a life for himself as an intellectual, first as a journalist in 1930s Paris, and then, after a harrowing escape to New York in 1941, as a scholar. Although he never taught at a university or even earned a PhD, Szajkowski became one of the world's foremost experts on the history of the Jews in modern France, publishing in Yiddish, English, and Hebrew. His work opened up new ways of thinking about Jewish emancipation, economic and social modernization, and the rise of modern anti-Semitism. <br><br>But beneath Szajkowski's scholarly accomplishments lay his shameful secret: his pathbreaking articles were based upon documents that he moved illicitly to New York. Eventually, he sold these documents, piecemeal, to American and Israeli research libraries where they still remain. Leff takes us into the backstage of the archives, revealing the powerful ideological, economic, and psychological forces that made Holocaust-era Jewish scholars care more deeply than ever before about preserving the remnants of their past. As Leff shows, it is only when we understand the issues at the heart of his story, in all their ambiguity and complexity, that we can begin to address the larger questions of the rightful ownership of Jewish archives, as well as other contested archives, that are still at issue today.<br></p><p><br><b>Lisa Moses Leff </b>is Professor of History at American University in Washington, D.C. She is the author of <i>Sacred Bonds of Solidarity: The Rise of Jewish Internationalism in Nineteenth-Century France</i>.<br>"[A] riveting portrait of an enigmatic scholar and a reflection about the construction of archives....[A] richly researched, lucidly written and, ultimately, deeply moving book....Lisa Moses Leff has made an invaluable contribution to the expanding literatures on postwar communal reconstruction and Jewish cultural restitution."--Geraldine Gudefin, <em>H-Judaic</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Archive Thief</em> is a richly researched, lucidly written and, ultimately, deeply moving book The book is all the more engaging that its author is able to situate Szajkowski's actions within the context of postwar discussions about the rightful ownership of archives. Finally, Leff makes a very persuasive argument about the ambiguous legacy of Szajkowski's collecting and sales."--Geraldine Gudefin, <em>H-Judaic</em><p></p><br>"How the chaos, needs, and rivalries of post-Second World War Jewish collectors and institutions played into [Szajkowski's] hands, is the subject of Lisa Moses Leff's engrossing and painstakingly documented book. Her research was made all the more demanding by the fact that there is no way of knowing all that is actually missing from collections. It is the wider context of her book that is so fascinating, for it raises important questions about the very nature of archives themselves, particularly what she calls 'archives of catastrophe.'"--Times Literary Supplement <br><p></p><br>"Through Szajkowski's personal biography, Leff has illuminated the larger story of how Jewish archives and libraries were constructed and reconfigured in the aftermath of World War II, as the centers of gravity in the Jewish world shifted from Europe to Israel and the United States...Leff casts new light on this transformative moment in postwar Jewish life. As a result of her beautifully written and deeply researched book, we have a greater appreciation of the degree to which the libraries and archives on which we depend are themselves "historical artifacts." In this sense, Leff's thought-provoking and imaginative book raises questions that will intrigue all historians. This work also constitutes a fitting tribute to a man who, despite his flaws and weaknesses, made immense contributions to the field of Jewish history."--Jewish History <br><p></p><br>"[A] brilliant new book...Leff has produced a page-turning account that offers a model for how post-Holocaust Jewish history should be written. The work ponders questions that should interest both specialist and generalist readers and ought to be assigned widely and debated extensively."--English Historical Review<p></p><br>"[A] superb book...Pages fly by as her meticulous and surprising study of the extraordinary life of her 'hero' keeps her reader breathless...[A]n astonishing work of history, founded on a group of original documents by means of which she raises fundamental questions about the very nature of the archive as it fluctuates between being a state memoir and a way to preserve a particular history and culture."--Journal of Modern History<p></p><br>"Lisa Moses Leff tells Szajkowski's fascinating story in a book as gripping as a crime novel, with profound insight into the role played by archive collections in the modern construction of national histories Leff creates a complex portrait of this 'archive thief,' who was no simple villain Szajkowski's story is stunning and Leff tells it exceptionally well. The Archive Thief is a meticulously researched scholarly work that deftly incorporates archival sources, Szajkowski's published writings, and his private correspondence. It is beautifully written and sophisticated without ever becoming pedantic."--H-France <br><p></p><br>"The Archive Thief is a richly detailed and sympathetic portrait that unfolds with elements of a detective story. In writing about the trajectory of Szajkowski's life and career, she raises provocative questions about the nature of collecting, the role of archives and where they belong, and the very writing of history."--Jewish Week <br><p></p><br>"Leff, in this deeply researched and intriguing book, draws a nuanced portrait of a scholar who turned to crime to preserve his status as a historian of modern Jewish history."--Times of Israel <br><p></p><br>"A work of learned detection and a history of the making of history, this absorbing study is also a portrait of, perhaps, the oddest of all creators of modern Jewish scholarship. A shy, roguish, charming man, self-taught, an erstwhile Communist and fighter in the French Foreign Legion, Zosa Szajkowski's jagged, complex life is explored in this work with perceptiveness, and commendable empathy."--Steven J. Zipperstein, Daniel E. Koshland Professor in Jewish Culture and History, Stanford University<p></p><br>"With her dogged research, keen analysis and scintillating writing, Lisa Leff in The Archive Thief marries historical scholarship with the detective genre. The story of Zosa Szajkowski could have been - and maybe still will be--the stuff of a great mystery novel, played out on multiple continents, with a perplexing villain who sometimes seems like a hero. But instead Lisa Leff has used these details to show the complex work done by archives and the deep ideological meaning associated with the documents of the past."--Hasia Diner, Paul S. and Sylvia Steinberg Professor of American Jewish History and Director of the Goldstein-Goren Center for American Jewish History, New York University<p></p><br>"Why did an accomplished Jewish historian steal tens of thousands of historical documents? In unraveling that mystery, Lisa Moses Leff has created a compelling personal portrait, while at the same time elucidating key issues of Jewish history and historiography in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Meticulously researched and beautifully written, The Archive Thief is more than just a fine work of scholarship; it is also a page-turner."--Aaron Lansky, author of Outwitting History: The Amazing Adventures of a Man Who Rescued a Million Yiddish Books<p></p><br>"One of Leff's many illuminating discussions treats the impact of Szajkowski's thefts and the role of archives and archivists generally in shaping the history we tell." <em>World Literature Today</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Oroonoko, and Other Writings (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The most complete collection of the work of Aphra Behn (1640-89) available, this volume contains <em>Oroonoko</em> and five other works of fiction ranging from comedy and high melodrama to tragedy.

Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud.

How, that is, does she conceptualize the needs of the patient while simultaneously enlisting him or her as an active partner in formulating an individualized working plan? And how should supervisors teach the skills needed to make the intake procedure truly the beginning of treatment? In <em>Beginnings: The Art and Science of Planning Psychotherapy</em> Mary Jo Peebles-Kleiger tackles these and other questions in an authoritative manner that draws on the cumulative experience of the outpatient department of the Menninger Psychiatric Clinic.</p> <p>Peebles-Kleiger's elegant synoptic discussions of the major categories of psychological dysfunction and the different treatment strategies appropriate to them are carefully calibrated, with actual examples, to the limits and opportunities of the first sessions. Of particular value is her unusual capacity to articulate patients' various difficulties in forming and maintaining an alliance, and then to show how such difficulties feed back into the clinician's interventions in the first few sessions. In this manner, she illustrates how potential treatment obstacles-- difficulties in affect regulation, in reality testing, in conscience formation, among others--can be assessed and subjected to trial interventions from the very start.</p> <p>Skilled in various psychodynamic and behavioral approaches, from psychoanalysis to hypnotherapy, Peebles-Kleiger consistently advances an integrative approach that cuts across specific modalities and combines sophisticated psychodynamic understanding with the fruits of empirical research. Both primer and sourcebook, <em>Beginnings: The Art and Science of Planning Psychotherapy</em> fills a niche in the literature so admirably that clinicians will find it indispensible in planning humanely responsive treatment in an increasingly complex therapeutic world.</p></p><p>A graduate of the Topeka Institute of Psychoanalysis and former member of the medical staff of Chestnut Lodge Hospital, Mary Jo Peebles-Kleiger, Ph.D., worked, supervised, and taught at the Menninger Clinic for nearly two decades.&nbsp; In addition to being a psychoanalyst, she has trained in biofeedback and EMDR and is board-certified in both clinical psychology and clinical hypnosis.&nbsp; She is currently in private practice in Bethesda, MD.<p>"A superb integration of theory, empirical reseach, and clinical wisdom.&nbsp; <em>Beginnings</em> brings together in a wonderful way advances in psychological research, psychotherapy theory, and practical planning of a treatment intervention.&nbsp; It presents the best available introductory text to guide the young psychotherapist through the labyrinth of theories, findings, and recommendations that can often destroy the natural creativity of the beginning practitioner or even those of us who are more experienced."</p> <p>- Peter Fonagy, Ph.D., Freud Memorial Professor of Psychoanalysis, University College London</p> <p>"Dr. Peebles-Kleiger has written a masterful and comprehensive summary of how the psychotherapist should think in developing a psychotherapeutic treatment plan for patients.&nbsp; She accomplishes the difficult task of being both scholarly and practical at the same time.&nbsp; Her book will be equally useful for students and experienced clinicians alike."</p> <p>- Glen O. Gabbard, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, Baylor College of Medicine</p> <p>"This comprehensive guide to planning psychotherapy is noteworthy for cutting across a broad range of treatment models and exploring universal factors that clinicians should consider in the beginning phase of psychotherapy.&nbsp; Peebles-Kleiger describes and illustrates the treatment planning process in a step-by-step, highly readable, and user-friendly manner while also showing how it is grounded in clinical writings and research.&nbsp; Any clinician or trainee who is engaged in, or learning about, the practice of psychotherapy will find <em>Beginnings</em> a valuable guide and an important resource."</p> <p>- Eda G.

The authors use the opinion by Maryland&#x2019;s Court of Appeals which considered whether researchers at Johns Hopkins University&#x2019;s prestigious Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) engaged in unethical research on 108 African-American children as a springboard to ask fundamental questions about the practice and future of public health. <i>Lead Wars</i> chronicles the obstacles faced by public health workers in the conservative, pro-business, anti-regulatory climate that took off in the Reagan years and that stymied efforts to eliminate lead from the environments and the bodies of American children.</p><p>The story Rosner and Markowitz tell of generations of children gravely damaged by promiscuous dispersal of lead, and the persistent attempts made to evade responsibility for the harms caused, is both true and shocking. This book will not just educate future environmental and health leaders, it should outrage them.&#x201d; Richard J. Jackson MD, MPH, Professor and Chair, Environmental Health Sciences, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health<br><br> "<i>Lead Wars</i> argues that the tragedy of lead is one that our society is doomed to repeat again and again unless we develop better safeguards to protect us against chemicals and new technology. This book is a "must read" for public health professionals as well as for political scientists, social historians and for all who care about the future of America's children." Philip J. Landrigan MD, Ethel H. Wise Professor of Community Medicine and Chairman in the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine<br><br> "Can being poor justify differing standards for research or a focus merely on harm reduction and the politically feasible? Markowitz and Rosner make the compelling case that in public health the practical and possible may in the end be immoral and dangerous, and a consequence of the war on science. A necessary read for anyone who cares about public health, the role of government, children, medical experimentation and environmental justice." Susan M. Reverby, McLean Professor in the History of Ideas and Professor of Women's and Gender Studies, Wellesley College<br><br> Lead poisoning remains a tragedy (and scandal) of immense proportions, and the authors utilize new sources including previously unexamined court records to tell a story that is as gripping as it is important.&#x201d; Robert N. Proctor, Professor of the History of Science at Stanford University and author of <i>Cancer Wars</i><br><br> "This book tells the story of a public health tragedy affecting millions of children, the determined doctors who tried to help, and an industry propaganda campaign which prolonged and worsened the tragedy. For as long as powerful corporations manipulate politicians and public opinion to profit from dangerous products, this will remain an important story for our country." Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Senator<br><br><i>"Lead Wars</i> makes clear the public health dangers we face if we continue to ignore this corporate strategy that defines acceptable&#x201d; levels of risk for the thousands of chemicals in use. It brings home the importance now more than ever of taking a precautionary approach to managing toxic chemicals. This book is a must for any activist who wants to understand the strategies polluters use to continue business as usual." Lois Marie Gibbs, Executive Director, Center for Health, Environment &amp; Justice<br><br> "In this outstanding book, Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner utilize historical scholarship to expose a major tragedy in recent public health: the failure to protect children from the harms of lead in our environment. Despite the fact that the toxic effects of lead have been known for centuries, they show using previously unavailable documents how the lead industry has protected their profits at public expense, despite their explicit knowledge of its many dangers. <i>Lead Wars</i> brings this tragic history to light in a narrative that integrates deep investigation and analysis with compelling advocacy and compassion for children who continue to be at risk from one of the world&#x2019;s best-known toxins." Allan M. Brandt, Professor of the History of Medicine at Harvard University, and author of <i>The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America</i><br><br> "Markowitz and Rosner have majestically woven the key characters and elements of the history of lead poisoning into a captivating narrative that exposes a tremendous and terrifying truth; unless it serves the needs of private enterprise, public health is incapable of controlling the causes of chronic disease and disability. In place of prevention, we have settled for partial solutions. Everyone who has an interest in public health, health policy or history should read this book."

Mayer calls the forgotten revolutionaries of the War for American Independence. These merchants, contractors, family members, servants, government officers, and military employees provided necessary supplies, services, and emotional support to the troops of the Continental Army. Mayer describes their activities and demonstrates how they made encampments livable communities and played a fundamental role in the survival and ultimate success of the Continental Army. She also considers how the army wanted to be rid of the followers but were unsuccessful because of the civilians&#39; essential support functions and determination to make camps into communities. Instead the civilians&#39; assimilation gave an expansive meaning to the term &#34;belonging to the army</p><p>After four years on active duty in the U.S. Army, Holly A.

Synthesizing a vast body of literature, Spinney presents Chicago in terms of the people whose lives made the city&#x2014;not only the tycoons and the politicians but also the hundreds of thousands of immigrants from all over the world who have kept the city working. <br><br><i>City of Big Shoulders</i> sweeps across the colorful and dramatic panorama of Chicago's explosive past. How did the pungent swamplands that the Native Americans called the wild-garlic place mushroom into one of the world's largest and most sophisticated cities? What is the real story behind the Great Chicago Fire? What aspects of American industry exploded with the bomb in Haymarket Square? Did the 1920s in Chicago roar as loudly as Hollywood would have us believe? <br><br>A city of immigrants and entrepreneurs, Chicago is quintessentially American. Spinney traces formative events in the city's history, bringing to life the people, events, and institutions that are most important for understanding Chicago's story. From Fort Dearborn to Cabrini-Green, P�re Marquette to Mayor Daley, the Union Stockyards to the Chicago Bulls, <i>City of Big Shoulders</i> draws together diverse threads of the city's development, shedding light on underlying social and economic causes of major events and, especially, on the roles of ordinary people. <br><br>Engaging and highly informative, this account will interest students and teachers of urban history, as well as anyone looking for a brisk overview of Chicago's history. Historic photographs and informative tables illuminate the narrative.</p></p><p>Robert Spinney taught Chicago history for a number of years. He is the author of World War II in Nashville.One wonders how Chicagoans have felt being saddled, since the 1920s, with the sobriquet "hog butcher for the world"Afrom the first line of Carl Sandburg's ode to the vitality of the second city. For this condensed yet energetic and substantial history of Chicago, Spinney has appropriately chosen the reference from Sandburg's poem's fifth line, to a "city of big shoulders"Afor so much of the city's story emerges from the interwoven struggles of American-born and immigrant workers. Beginning with the earliest glimmerings of what was to become a major American cityAChigagou is a Native American word meaning "the wild garlic place"Athis history moves from the influx of European missionaries, traders and explorers in 1673 to those who populated the preeminent boom town in the mid-19th century to the enormous tide of European immigrants who occupied Chicago in the latter half of that century. Spinney (World War II in Nashville), a former professor of history, has a firm sense of historical narrative as well as a keen eye for entertaining and illuminating detail. He deftly illustrates how differences in assimilation patterns affected city politicsAthe Poles retained their national identity amid tightly controlled neighborhoods; the Italians came to Chicago to work and then returned to Italy; while the Irish moved into positions of civil power. He also successfully draws upon important historical moments, such as the great fire, the Haymarket massacre, the Columbian Exposition of 1893 and the careers of politicians like William "Big Bill" Thompson and Richard Daley, to illustrate the greater themes and struggles in the city's history.

Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.While awaiting trial for an initially unspecified crime, Vietnam vet and college professor Eugene Debs Hartke realizes that he has killed exactly as many people as he has had sex with, a coincidence that causes him to doubt his atheism. According to PW , "The cumulative power of the novel is considerable, revealing Vonnegut at his fanciful and playful best." <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Annihilation: A Global Military History of World War II</h2><p>From 1937 to 1945 the world witnessed a succession of savage military strategies and actions on land, in the seas, and in the skies that resulted in the slaughter of more than 50 million people. Incorporating the most recent scholarship on the military history of the Second World War, this study offers a chronological and geographical examination of the most destructive event in recorded human history. <br><br><em>Annihilation</em> argues that World War II evolved into a war of annihilation--a total war--that engulfed militants and civilians alike. The book challenges the "good war" thesis by showing that the "strategy of annihilation" was employed by all sides in the conflict. Moving from the onset of hostilities to the final days of battle, the narrative provides a global perspective that links all theaters of the war.

"A magnificent tribute to the probity, consistency and insight of Orwell's topical writings....A remarkable self-portrait" (Alfred Kazin, Book World). Edited by Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus; Index.<br></p><p>The years spanned by this collection--1945-1950--were monumental ones for George Orwell, years in which his literary reputation and his bank account grew in tandem, thanks to the publication of <i>Animal Farm</i> and <i>1984</i>. The realignments brought about by the end of World War II and Orwell's increasingly virulent anti-Stalinism provided ample fodder for the political journalist. Regular columns in British papers and frequent contributions to such American journals as the <i>Partisan Review</i> exercised the literary critic, the essayist, and the commentator on popular culture. Even while grieving for his first wife, caring for his adopted toddler son, bedridden by the lung ailments that killed him early in 1950, Orwell was still regularly producing four pieces every week. Increasingly, his social life took place by mail.<p> The brave, wistful letters Orwell wrote to personal friends and professional colleagues in his last year show him trying to imagine a future even as he put his affairs in order. On 11 May 1949, he closed one to fellow novelist Anthony Powell: "It looks as if I may have to spend the rest of my life, if not actually in bed, at any rate at the bath-chair level. I could stand that for say 5 years if only I could work. At present I can do nothing, not even a book review. Please give everyone my love." </p><p> The essays in this collection include such keepers as "Such, Such Were the Joys," a long, harrowing memoir of Orwell's days at a British prep school; "Politics and the English Language," which examines the symbiosis of what it is possible to say in words and what it is possible to think; "How the Poor Die," a chilling piece of social reporting; and "Good Bad Books," in which he opines, "The fact that one can be amused or excited or even moved by a book that one's intellect simply refuses to take seriously is a reminder that art is not the same thing as cerebration."</p><p> Bringing together the public utterances and the private correspondence of a writer at the top of his game and the end of his life, this volume is worth reading for the individual pieces, some of Orwell's finest, as well as for the portrait it yields of a highly intelligent and principled man doing his best to play the hand fate dealt him with integrity and grace. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i></p>GEORGE ORWELL (1903&#x2013;1950)&nbsp;was born in India and served with the Imperial Police in Burma before joining the Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. Orwell was the author of six novels&nbsp;as well as numerous essays and nonfiction works.</p><h2>Pilgrimage on a Steel Ride: A Memoir About Men and Motorcycles</h2><p>The author describes his motorcycle journey through Minnesota to the Alaskan Highway, recalling the events in his life that have made him the man he is today, from the tough cop who saved him from delinquency to wrangling a dogsled through the Alaskan wilderness, and other challenges he has faced on the road of life. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>At 57, with heart disease and a bad case of wanderlust, Gary Paulsen decided to get himself the motorcycle of his dreams and take it to Alaska from his home in New Mexico. "The bike held me like a hand, caught me and took me with it so that the engine seemed to be my engine, the wheels my wheels," he writes. "It was singular, visceral, unlike any other motorcycle I had ever ridden. In some way it brought me out of myself, out ahead of myself, into myself, into the core of what I was, what I needed to live. And I knew, my core knew that I would never be the same again, could never be the same."<p> Paulsen writes in a blaze of macho invective, about men who like drinkin' and butcherin' and guns and "poker with no-limits stakes, or stakes high enough to make you intensely focus on everything there is--and there is everything--in the game." But when he's writing about the spicy characters he's encountered in his wide-ranging travels around America, this short memoir, for all its exaggerated manliness, turns out to be quite funny. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>Lyrical and pleasing reflections on machinery, midlife crisis, and sundry other matters. Not long ago Paulsen, a Newbury Honor author of books for children, as well as books for adults (Eastern Sun, Western Moon, 1993, etc.), turned 57 and discovered he had a heart ailment. He also discovered, he writes, that he is a man, in a time when it has become anachronistic to be masculine. To avert the horror of growing old, cuddly, and debilitated, Paulsen went out and bought a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, shopping for which turned out to be a challenge--for a new bike, he learned, he'd have to pay a small fortune and then wait three years for delivery. Arming himself with a used machine, he took to the road, making his way from New Mexico to Alaska and back again, celebrating the freedom afforded him by the Harley-as-extension-of-self. The book that resulted from his trip is really a series of loosely connected essays. One treats the curious career of George Armstrong Custer, whom Paulsen seems intent on rehabilitating. Writing in a Hemingwayesque turn, he takes the line that, while it is politically incorrect to express respect for the doomed general, it is difficult not to admire his courage, and in the end it could be said that he was given his measure of fame--which is more than most men are given. Another essay explores the American worship of know-how, the almost religious aspect of being a mechanic that does not seem to exist in other countries. Still another deals with the myriad ways there are to meet one's maker on the back of a motorcycle, crushed by an errant piece of livestock or splattered by a road-hogging RV. These meditations don't quite add up to a full-tilt memoir, but they make a nice entertainment all the same. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In both prose and verse, Pushkin was one of the world&#x2019;s great storytellers: direct and dramatic, clear-sighted, vivid, and passionate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This new and expanded Everyman&#x2019;s edition of his stories includes all the mature work. In addition to such novella-length masterpieces as The Captain&#x2019;s Daughter and The Tales of Belkin the collection now contains many more short pieces and the masterly History of Pugachev, a powerful account of the man who rebelled against Catherine the Great.&nbsp; This version is translated by Paul Debreczeny and Walter Arndt.<br><br></p></p><p>Alexander Pushkin&nbsp;(1799-1837) was a poet, playwright, and novelist who achieved literary prominence before he was twenty. His radical politics led to government censorship and periods of banishment from the capital, but he eventually married a popular society beauty and became a regular part of court life. Notoriously touchy about his honor, he died at age thirty-seven in a duel with his wife's alleged lover.&#x201c;Pushkin is not only Russia&#x2019;s primary and archetypal author but her most astonishingly versatile one . . . There is something Mozartian about his genius, which is replete in the same manner with variety, gaiety, and depth . . . [His prose stories] are not only as much masterpieces as his tales in verse, but carry the same <br>unmistakable and original stamp of his style and personality.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;from the Introduction by John Bayley</p><h2>The Making of Urban America. A History of City Planning in the United States</h2><p><p>This comprehensive survey of urban growth in America has become a standard work in the field. From the early colonial period to the First World War, John Reps explores to what extent city planning has been rooted in the nation's tradition, showing the extent of European influence on early communities. Illustrated by over three hundred reproductions of maps, plans, and panoramic views, this book presents hundreds of American cities and the unique factors affecting their development.</p></p><p><b>John W. Reps</b> is Professor Emeritus of City and Regional Planning at the College of Architecture, Cornell University. His works include <i>Cities of the American West: A History of Urban Planning</i> (Princeton)."An extraordinarily handsome volume." (<i>The Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>"An exhaustive research document on the history of city planning in the United States. . . . A cartographic gem." (<i>The New York Times</i>)<br><br>"This excellent book may well be described as the missing link in American town planning history. No book [to date] has comprehensively dealt with American urban development from the earliest colonial settlements to modern times. Reps has filled this gap with his lavishly illustrated work." (<i>Journal of the Town Planning Institute</i>)</p><h2>Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care Programmes</h2><p>The highly successful textbook Methods for the Economic Evaluation of Health Care is now available in its third edition. Over the years it has become the standard textbook in the field world-wide. It mirrors the huge expansion of the field of economic evaluation in health care.<br> <br> This new edition builds on the strengths of previous editions being clearly written in a style accessible to a wide readership. Key methodological principles are outlined using a critical appraisal checklist that can be applied to any published study. The methodological features of the basic forms of analysis are then explained in more detail with special emphasis of the latest views on productivity costs, the characterization of uncertainty and the concept of net benefit. The book has been greatly revised and expanded especially concerning analyzing patient-level data and decision-analytic modeling. There is discussion of new methodological approaches, including cost effectiveness acceptability curves, net benefit regression, probalistic sensitivity analysis and value of information analysis. There is an expanded chapter on the use of economic evaluation, including discussion of the use of cost-effectiveness thresholds, equity considerations and the transferability of economic data.<br> <br> This new edition is required for anyone commissioning, undertaking or using economic evaluations in health care, and will be popular with health service professionals, health economists, pharmacists and health care decision makers. It is especially relevant for those taking pharmacoeconomics courses.</p><p><br><strong>Michael F.

Had he accomplished nothing in the Civil War, Richard Taylor would still have been historically noteworthy: Gifted problem-son of Zachary Taylor and brother-in-law of Jefferson Davis, he graduated from Yale in 1845 at age 19 and acquired great wealth at his father's death in 1850. As heir to the fabulous plantation of Fashion, Taylor became one of Louisiana's most prominent planters and slaveholders (and, thanks to his consequent involvement in local politics, one of the state's leading political figures). Parrish depicts Taylor as highly intelligent, cultivated, and enlightened, sensitive to the moral dilemmas of slavery and humane and paternalistic toward his many slaves. According to the author, Taylor decried slavery as a moral evil--but not evil enough, apparently, for him to manumit his own slaves. Taylor disapproved of the radical rhetoric of the secessionist ``fire-eaters,'' but, like many Southern planters, he was radicalized by John Brown's abortive raid on the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry. Though his father was a Whig President, and he himself nurtured pro-Union sentiments, Taylor gradually allowed himself to be drawn (albeit, Parrish indicates, with great reluctance) into the secessionist fringe of the Democratic Party at the fractious 1860 Charleston convention. After Louisiana's secession (which he voted in favor of), Taylor entered Confederate service as a colonel of the Louisiana Brigade and achieved distinction as a commander under Stonewall Jackson in the legendary Valley campaign in 1862. Transferred to Louisiana to repel the Federal offensive there, he succeeded in 1864 in stopping General Banks's Red River Campaign. After the war, Taylor became a leading advocate of states' rights and finished Destruction and Reconstruction, one of the most distinguished Civil War memoirs, shortly before his death in 1879. A thorough and significant contribution to Civil War scholarship. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And yet in many ways, these daring men remain little known to us. Like most other poor working people of the past, they left few first-hand accounts of their lives. But their lives are not beyond recovery. In this book, Marcus Rediker uses a huge array of historical sources (court records, diaries, travel accounts, and many others) to reconstruct the social cultural world of the Anglo-American seamen and pirates who sailed the seas in the first half of the eighteenth century. Rediker tours the sailor&#39;s North Atlantic, following seamen and their ships along the pulsing routes of trade and into rowdy port towns. He recreates life along the waterfront, where seafaring men from around the world crowded into the sailortown and its brothels, alehouses, street brawls, and city jail. His study explores the natural terror that inevitably shaped the existence of those who plied the forbidding oceans of the globe in small, brittle wooden vessels. It also treats the man-made terror--the harsh discipline, brutal floggings, and grisly hangings--that was a central fact of life at sea. Rediker surveys the commonplaces of the maritime world: the monotonous rounds of daily labor, the negotiations of wage contracts, and the bawdy singing, dancing, and tale telling that were a part of every voyage. He also analyzes the dramatic moments of the sailor&#39;s existence, as Jack Tar battled wind and water during a slashing storm, as he stood by his &#34;brother tars&#34; in a mutiny or a stike, and as he risked his neck by joining a band of outlaws beneath the Jolly Roger, the notorious pirate flag. Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea focuses upon the seaman&#39;s experience in order to illuminate larger historical issues such as the rise of capitalism, the genesis the free wage labor, and the growth of an international working class. These epic themes were intimately bound up with everyday hopes and fears of the common seamen.</p><p>This unsparing account of the eighteenth-century maritime world reconstructs the often brutal social and cultural milieu of Anglo-American seafaring and piracy, following sailors and their ships from their trade routes into rowdy waterfront ports."...an excellent up-from-the-lower deck study of deepwater sailors in the eighteenth century...the best working-class history I've read in years."

Acknowledged as her heir by Elizabeth I, Arbella?s right to the English throne was equaled only by James. Kept under close supervision by her grandmother, but still surrounded by plots -- most of them Roman Catholic in origin -- she became an important pawn in the struggle for succession, particularly during the long, tense period when Elizabeth I lay dying. Her fate was sealed however when, upon James?s succession and having been invited back to court, Arbella made a treasonous marriage for which she was forced to flee England. She was intercepted off the coast of Calais and escorted to the Tower, where she died some years later, alone and, most probably, from starvation. <br> <br>For fans of historical biography, Arbella is possibly the most romantic heroine of them all.

The eight foundational lectures Hall delivered at the University of Illinois in 1983 introduced North American audiences to a thinker and discipline that would shift the course of critical scholarship. Unavailable until now, these lectures present Hall's original engagements with the theoretical positions that contributed to the formation of Cultural Studies. Throughout this personally guided tour of Cultural Studies' intellectual genealogy, Hall discusses the work of Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, and E. P. Thompson; the influence of structuralism; the limitations and possibilities of Marxist theory; and the importance of Althusser and Gramsci. Throughout these theoretical reflections, Hall insists that Cultural Studies aims to provide the means for political change.</p><p>Stuart Hall (1932&#x2013;2014) was one of the most prominent and influential scholars and public intellectuals of his generation. He was a prolific writer and speaker and a public voice for critical intelligence and social justice who appeared widely on British television and radio. He taught at the University of Birmingham and the Open University, was the founding editor of <i>New Left Review</i>, and served as the director of Birmingham&#x2019;s Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies during its most creative and influential decade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennifer Daryl Slack is Professor of Communication and Cultural Studies at Michigan Technological University.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lawrence Grossberg is Morris David Distinguished Professor of Communication and Cultural Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill."Hall&#x2019;s lectures from 1983 appear to be a peculiar event of appropriation&#x2014;a fundamental attempt to retain Marx as a nondisposable basis for cultural studies by means of a meticulous, well-informed, and earnest guarding of his heritage from vulgar and reductive misreadings.

He shows that there is no single route to sustainability and no such thing as a green aesthetic. Rather, through a range of building types, he demonstrates that increased awareness of a building&#x2019;s setting combined with advances in technology create unlimited opportunities for responsive design. Generously illustrated with four-color photographs and plans, the book includes work by an international roster of architects, including Norman Foster, Neutelings Riedijk Architecten, Herzog + Partner, and Renzo Piano. 164 color photos and drawings</p><p>Architect, writer, critic, and consultant in environmental design and planning, Peter Buchanan lives in London.His astute descriptions...give [the] reader a strong understanding of how architecture can...help reduce the negative impacts of primarily Western societies.

It tells of Odysseus&#39; adventurous wanderings as he returns from the long war at Troy to his home in the Greek island of Ithaca, where his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus have been waiting for him for twenty years. He meets a one-eyed giant, Polyphemus the Cyclops; he visits the underworld; he faces the terrible monsters Scylla and Charybdis; he extricates himself from the charms of Circe and Calypso. After these and numerous other legendary encounters he finally reaches home, where, disguised as a beggar, he begins to plan revenge on the suitors who have for years been besieging Penelope and feasting on his own meat and wine with insolent impunity.</p><p>The Oxford Classical Texts, or Scriptorum Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxoniensis, are renowned for their reliability and presentation.

She lives in Los Angeles. <strong>Jeff Crosby's</strong> work has appeared in numerous books and magazines. <em>Brave Cloelia</em> is his sixth children's book. He lives in Manhattan with his partner, Shelley, and their two dogs, Baron and Millie.<br>Gr. 2-4, younger for reading aloud. Because King Larth and the Etruscan soldiers have besieged Rome and demanded 200 hostages, Cloelia and her family are sent to the Etruscan camp. Two nights later, Cloelia leads a group of girls who escape from the guards and swim across the River Tiber, back to Rome. When King Larth demands her return, Cloelia goes with dignity and wins not only his respect but also the release of 40 more hostages. Perhaps historical, perhaps legendary, this story is based on Livy's <i>The History of Early Rome,</i> which was written several centuries after the events described. Though the opening paragraphs setting up the situation in the Etruscan camp are a bit stilted and confusing, the rest of the story reads well. Some of the colorful illustrations feature pleasing scenes and sensitive portrayals of individuals, while others seem stiff and idealized. The ancient Roman setting makes this picture book for older children a natural for schools with a classical curriculum, though consider it a secondary choice for the target audience. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Fanny is content in her role as a tweedy housewife with &#39;ghastly&#39; clothes, but her life changes overnight when Alfred is appointed English Ambassador to Paris. Suddenly she is mixing with royalty and Rothschilds, hosting cocktail parties and having details of her every move and outfit printed in the papers. As if that wasn&#39;t all more than enough to contend with, she also finds herself dealing with an aristocratic squatter, organising her friends&#39; love lives and keeping track of her maverick sons. All she needs now is a diplomatic crisis...</p><p>Nancy Mitford (1904-1973) was born in London, the eldest child of the second Baron Redesdale. Her childhood in a large remote country house with her five sisters and one brother is recounted in the early chapters of The Pursuit of Love (1945), which according to the author, is largely autobiographical. After the war she moved, with her husband, to Paris where she lived for the rest of her life. She followed the success of The Pursuit of Love with Love in a Cold Climate (1949) The Blessing (1951) and Don&#39;t Tell Alfred (1960), published together in Penguin as The Nancy Mitford Omnibus. She also wrote four works of biography; Madame de Pompadour, first published to great acclaim in 1954, Voltaire in Love, The Sun King and Frederick the Great.I<br> <br> On the day which was to be such a turning-point in my life, I went to London by the 9.07. I had planned to do a little shopping; somebody had told me of Chinese robes in the sales, perfect for dinner at home since they would cover up everything. I was also going to see my naughty boy, Basil, a perennial worry to me; Aunt Sadie begged me to look in on Uncle Matthew and there was something I had long wanted to put to him. I had appointments to lunch with the one and to have tea with the other. It was a Saturday because that was Basil&#x2019;s half-holiday &#x2013; he was cramming for the Foreign Office. We were to meet at a restaurant, then go back to his lodgings, what used to be called &#x2018;rooms&#x2019; and is now called a &#x2018;service flat&#x2019;. My idea was to do a little, surely much needed, tidying up there, as well as to collect some dirty clothes, and bring them back with me to have them washed or cleaned. I took a large canvas hold-all to contain them and the Chinese robe, if I bought it. <br> &nbsp;<br> But, oh dear, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever looked such a fool as I did in that Chinese robe, with my brown walking shoes, enormous beneath the hem, hair untidy from dragging off&nbsp; a hat, leather bag clasped to bosom because it had �28 in it and I knew that people snatched bags at sales. The assistant earnestly said think of the difference if I were carefully <i>coiff�e</i> and <i>maquill�e</i> and <i>parfum�e</i> and <i>manicur�e</i> and <i>pedicur�e</i>, wearing Chinese sandals (next department, 35/6) and lying on a couch in a soft light. It was no good, however &#x2013; my imagination could not get to work on all these hypotheses; I felt both hot and bothered; I tore the robe from me and fl ed from the displeasure of the saleswoman. <br> &nbsp;<br> I had made my plan with Basil some days before, on the telephone. Like all the children he is quite incapable of either reading or writing a letter. I was rather more worried about him than usual; last time he had come to Oxford his clothes had been distinctly on the Teddy side while his hair combed (or rather pulled) over his forehead and worn in a bob at the back gave him a curiously horrible look. This, no doubt, is now the fashion and not in itself a cause for alarm. But when he was alone with me he had spoken about his future, saying that the prospect of the Foreign Service bored him and that he thought he could put his talent for languages to better account in some other career. The sinister words &#x2018;get rich quick&#x2019; were uttered. I was anxious to see him again and ask a few questions. It was a blow, therefore, though not a great surprise, when he failed to turn up at the restaurant. I lunched there alone and then went off to find his service flat. The address he had given me, in Islington, turned out to be a pretty old house, come down in the world (soon no doubt to come down altogether). There were five or six bells at the front door with cards attached; one bell had no card but somebody had scribbed Baz on the wall beside it. I pressed it, without much hope. Nobody came. I went on pressing at intervals. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> A sharp lad in Teddy costume was lounging in the street, eyeing me. Presently he came up and said, &#x2018;If it&#x2019;s old Baz you&#x2019;re after, he&#x2019;s gone to Spain.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rain, rain, go to Spain. &#x2018;And when will he be back again?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;When he comes for the next batch. Old Baz is a travel agent now, didn&#x2019;t you know? Joined up with his Grandad &#x2013; some people are lucky in their relations. Baz herds them out to the Costa Brava, goes into hiding while they live it up there and brings back the bodies a week later. Or that&#x2019;s the general idea &#x2013; he&#x2019;s only just started the work.&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> Travel agent &#x2013; Grandad &#x2013; what did the child mean? Was not this a line of talk intended to keep me here until a man who was walking up the street should be out of sight? There was nobody else about, this dread Teddy, armed, no doubt, with blades, was clearly after my bag and the �28. I gave him a nervous, idiotic smile. &#x2018;Thank you very much,&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;that&#x2019;s just what I thought. Good-bye and thank you.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Upper Street was near and very soon I was in a good old No. 19 sagely ambling towards Piccadilly. This sort of thing always happened when I tried to see Basil. Oh well, one must put oneself in his shoes. Why should he want to spend his Saturday afternoon with a middle-aged mother? What a bore for a young man, on his own for the first time, to have to watch this elderly woman messing about in his room and taking away his suits. All the same, it was not like him to throw one over quite so callously; what could have happened? How could I find out? Meanwhile here I was in London on a Saturday afternoon with nothing to do until tea-time. We were passing the National Gallery, but I felt too dispirited to go in. I decided to walk off my bad temper in the Park. <br> &nbsp;<br> Though I have lived in London for longish periods at various times in my life, I have never been a Londoner, so that its associations to me are more literary and historic than personal. Every time I visit it I am saddened by seeing changes for the worse: the growing inelegance; the loss of character; the disappearance of landmarks and their replacement by fl at and faceless glass houses. When I got off my bus at Hyde Park Corner, I looked sadly at the huge hotel where Montdore House used to be, in Park Lane. When first built it had been hailed as a triumph of modern architecture, but although it had only stood there for three years it had already become shabby, the colour of old teeth, and in an odd way out of date. I stumped off towards Kensington Gardens. Somebody had told me that Knightsbridge Barracks were soon to go, so I said good-bye to them. I had never looked at them very carefully &#x2013; I now saw that they were solid and well built in a pretty mixture of brick and stone. No masterpiece, but certainly far better than the glorified garage that would replace them. Wendy&#x2019;s Wishing Well is horribly altered, I noted, and what has happened to the trees in the Broad Walk? However, Kensington Palace is still there, though probably not for long, and eccentric old men are still sailing boats on the Round Pond, which has not, as yet, been dried and levelled and turned into a car park.</p><h2>A Culture of Fact: England, 1550&#x2013;1720</h2><p><p>Barbara J. Shapiro traces the surprising genesis of the "fact," a modern concept that, she convincingly demonstrates, originated not in natural science but in legal discourse. She follows the concept's evolution and diffusion across a variety of disciplines in early modern England, examining how the emerging "culture of fact" shaped the epistemological assumptions of each intellectual enterprise.</p><p>Drawing on an astonishing breadth of research, Shapiro probes the fact's changing identity from an alleged human action to a proven natural or human happening. The crucial first step in this transition occurred in the sixteenth century when English common law established a definition of fact which relied on eyewitnesses and testimony. The concept widened to cover natural as well as human events as a result of developments in news reportage and travel writing. Only then, Shapiro discovers, did scientific philosophy adopt the category "fact." With Francis Bacon advocating more stringent criteria, the witness became a vital component in scientific observation and experimentation. Shapiro also recounts how England's preoccupation with the fact influenced historiography, religion, and literature&#x2015;which saw the creation of a fact-oriented fictional genre, the novel.</p></p><p>"A Culture of Fact is a superb realization of a great idea. Erudite, conceptually rich, and thought provoking, it also constitutes an important supplement to several areas of scholarship in early modern English intellectual history."--Donald R. Kelley, James Westfall Thompson Professor of History, Rutgers University, and Editor, Journal of the History of Ideas <p>"Barbara Shapiro&#x2019;s original account of the concept of fact in early-modern English culture moves outward from law to virtually every area of professional and lay intellectual curiosity and endeavor. Thoughtful, learned, and admirably lucid, A Culture of Fact is an important contribution to the study of post-Medieval Western culture in general."--Thomas A.

Yet at the same time that he was making his name as an "intimist" artist, he was also creating a number of large-scale canvases, panels, and screens commissioned to decorate the homes of his patrons and friends. Infrequently exhibited, these works were separated from their original settings during Vuillard's lifetime, and they have remained a relatively unknown aspect of his oeuvre.<br>In this lavishly illustrated study of Vuillard as decorator, Gloria Groom examines the two earliest decades of his career, a period when he produced fifty daring and important large-scale paintings as decoration. Groom discusses these early works and recreates and re-evaluates their original context, providing valuable new information about Vuillard's career, a fresh perspective on his thinking about art, and an entertaining social history of fin-de-siecle Paris.<br>She describes not only Vuillard's large decorative projects but also the industrialists, bankers, doctors, financiers, journalists, playwrights, and foreign aristocrats who commissioned them, wealthy individuals who came from a social and economic milieu decidedly different from Vuillard's own. Drawing on his patrons' archives and memoirs, and on interviews with their surviving family members, as well as on Vuillard's own private journals, Groom evokes the circumstances and setting of each of these ambitious projects. She situates Vuillard's decorative works within the evolution of his other easel paintings, discusses the notion of "decoration" as a new painting style as well as a complement to the aesthetics of the art nouveau movement, and compares Vuillard's works as a painter-decorator to similar projects undertaken by his contemporaries.</p><p>Based on the author's dissertation of the same title (Univ. of Texas at Austin, 1989), this splendid volume deserves the attention of art students and scholars alike. Groom's depth of understanding and appreciation of Vuillard's unique contribution to the decorative arts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is clearly evident in the authoritative, well-documented text, which thoroughly analyzes Vuillard's major interior commissions from 1892 through 1913. The more than 300 high-quality illustrations elucidate Groom's analyses. Because so few of the artist's works remain in situ, reproduced photographs showing the original installations of some works are of particular interest. Extensive scholarly notes and a selective (but thorough) bibliography conclude the work. Highly recommended for all art collections.<br><i>- P.

The characters with whom she is entangled--the good man and the evil one, between whom she wavers, and the mysterious witchlike woman with whom she must do battle--are each rendered with a virtuosity that suggests dazzling imaginative powers.

The author emphasizes that all living and nonliving parts of our environment are comprised of chemicals and that all of the natural processes continuously occurring in the environment involve chemical reactions. With this concept of interdependence, students begin to see that without some understanding of chemistry, it is impossible to fully understand environmental issues such as ozone depletion, global warming, air and water pollution, and the hazards of radioactivity. The Third Edition includes a new chapter on Green Chemistry as well as numerous updates throughout to address the changes in the field.<br><br>Key Features:<br><br>- Includes a new chapter on Green Chemistry.<br>- A new key term glossary is now included at the end of the text.<br>- New feature boxes assess students understanding of chapter material with analytical questions and problems.<br>- Includes additional chemical equations throughout the text reinforce important concepts.<br>- Available with a new electronic student study guide and solutions manual <br>- Instructor's resources include PowerPoint� Lecture Outlines, answers to end of chapter problems, and a testbank.<br>- A student companion website includes chapter outlines, interactive glossary, flashcards, and weblinks.</p><p>American University</p><h2>The Complete Catalogue of the Land Rover: Production Variants from Series 1 to Defender</h2><p>The traditional utility Land Rover remains as much an enthusiast&#x2019;s choice as ever now that its production has been ended.<br><br> Between 1948 and 2016, there was a far greater variety of models produced &#x2013; an astonishing 300-plus &#x2013; than even the most ardent enthusiasts recognise, and this comprehensive and highly illustrated book is a guide to all of them &#x2013; both those built in Britain and those built (often with unique features) overseas.

He writes about the painters he has known and represented (among them James Rosenquist, Jasper Johns, Jean Dubuffet, and Joseph Cornell), and about others whose work he has collected. He writes about his galleries in Chicago and New York City, and about his fellow dealers, including Julien Levy and Leo Castelli. <br><br>He talks about the "eye" that allows a dealer to recognize a fine painting. He discusses the great art-owning families, art historians, scholars, and conservators. He recounts the story of the debacle at the Barnes Foundation that resulted in the undoing of Albert Barnes's vision for his museum, and reveals the fate of the artworks that belonged to Gertrude Stein. He dissects the art boom of the 1980s and its effects, and takes on the commercialism plaguing American museums today: blockbuster exhibitions and the replacement of great directors with "professional administrators."<br><br>Feigen has given us an intimate, engrossing portrait of the great art game as it has been played in the twentieth century.</p><p>In <i>Tales from the Art Crypt</i>, Richard Feigen, a veteran of nearly 50 years as an art dealer, offers not a conventional memoir but rather a series of highly polished anecdotes adding up to an illuminating dissection of art-world practice and politics. The opening chapter, aptly titled "Detective Stories," makes attributing an old master painting or unearthing a forgotten portrait of Thomas Jefferson as exciting as a murder mystery. Feigen's acid comments on the provincialism of his hometown, Chicago, explain his relocation to New York in the mid-1960s. His depictions of fellow dealers like Leo Castelli and Sam Salz are amusingly candid without seeming mean-spirited; affectionate portrayals of collectors such as Morton and Rose Neumann are equally vivid. Also memorable is a juicy account of his stint on the board of the Barnes Foundation, whose decision to deaccession works and permit a traveling exhibit of fragile paintings he deplores. Feigen, who has studied and sold everything from surrealist works and pop art to 17th-century Italian paintings, displays an infectious zest for art as both aesthetic pursuit and business. His comments on the conflicts between museum directors and their newly revenue-conscious boards of trustees explain much about the increasing commercialization of once scholarly institutions. His delightful book fulfills the mission museums once took for granted: to entertain and educate. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"Clear and disarming... Given the vast smoke screens raised by legendary dealers like Duveen about their sometimes dubious activities, this frank, detailed account by a mover and shaker in today's booming art market is sure to be discussed." <br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"Here is a fresh view from the art world. Thankfully, Mr. Feigen displays a greater love for good art than for common currency. He also shows a healthy contempt for prissy and ignorant museum leadership."<br>-- Frank Stella</p><h2>Pocket Guide to Psychiatric Nursing</h2><p><p>Here&#x2019;s the most complete and easy-to-use resource on how to develop practical, individualized plans of care for psychiatric and mental health patients.<br>It&#x2019;s really two books in one!

The steel, steam, and dreams of a century of railroading in New Mexico are captured in 200 photographs and a crisp text. From a bygone era of narrow-gauge lines to today's Amtrak service, this book covers both the short lines and the branches feeding to main lines of major railroad systems. </p><p>New Mexico, isolated until 1878 when the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad laid the first span of track in the territory, in just thirty months had over 1,000 miles of rail line. Soon trains of freight and passenger cars, marvel of the industrial age, crisscrossed the territory delivering eastern fashion, settlers, and tourists and hauling away lumber, coal, silver, and cattle. </p><p>The great railroad-building era in New Mexico ended with World War I, when eleven common carriers operated 3,000 miles of track. The subsequent history of New Mexico railroads is one of persistent struggle, slow eclipse, and corporate consolidation. But as this volume reminds us, steel rails, roaring engines, and clattering cars will always be a part of New Mexico's heritage. </p></p><p>From narrow-gauge lines to Amtrak, this railroad lover&#39;s book shows the importance of trains to New Mexico&#39;s heritage.David F.

Raised by her mother, known as the 'Princess of Parallelograms' for her passion for geometry, young Ada filled journals with invention ideas, particularly a flying machine. When the measles left Ada blind and paralyzed for years, her mother kept her mind sharp with number problems. And, of course, Ada dreamed of her flying machine. A healthier, teenage Ada was tutored by the accomplished female mathematician Mary Fairfax Somerville, and she was introduced to Charles Babbage and his Difference Machine, a revolutionary calculator. Despite their age difference (she 17 and he 41), Ada was considered an equal, and Babbage asked for her help with his Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer. As she spent months creating an algorithm for the machine, she developed a new profession: computer programming.

The mathematician, Charles Babbage, was trying to build a mechanical computer; he trusted Ada, a passionate scholar who had studied math with an eminent tutor, to write the instructions that would allow the machine to operate. Those instructions, published in 1843, are thought by many to be the first computer program. <strong>Wallmark brings the story alive with grace and clarity</strong>; she never showboats, but she always finds the right word or phrase.

Ever since she was a young girl, Lovelace was fascinated by numbers. As she was growing up, she filled her journals with ideas for inventions and equations. Her mother provided tutors to further develop Lovelace's passion for mathematics. When one of these tutors invited Lovelace and her mother to a gathering of scientists, she met the famous mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage. He was so impressed by Lovelace's knowledge that he invited her to his laboratory, where she learned about his idea for an Analytical Engine, a mechanical computer that would solve difficult problems by working them through step-by-step. She realized that this 'computer' would only work if it were provided with detailed instructions, and after much work, she succeeded in writing what is now referred to as the first computer program and in creating the profession of computer programming. The descriptive text and dazzling spreads work seamlessly to provide a sense of Lovelace's growing passion for mathematics and invention.

He is the translator of over fifty volumes of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, and Islamic texts from Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, Pali, and Arabic.It sometimes seems that Cleary translates esoteric texts from several different non-Western languages at a faster rate than many of us can read them in English. For more than 20 years, Cleary, who has a Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Literature from Harvard, has worked independently, translating 50-plus Confucian, Taoist, Buddhist, and Islamic texts. These two volumes are the first of four projected volumes of Taoist classics and introduce a larger series of Cleary's collected translations. If these indicate what is to come, the remainder of the series should be eagerly awaited. Because he is unaffiliated with any academic institution, Cleary's accuracy has been questioned from time to time, and he has been faulted for not including the footnotes and textual apparatus that usually accompany such works. For most readers, though, having these texts available in consistent versions and with enough explanatory material to place them in context far outweighs any deficiencies scholars might find. Of the two volumes here, the first presents more obscure texts and gives a much fuller picture of the scope and nature of Taoism and its relation to Confucianism and Buddhism in Chinese thought.

While retaining its comprehensive introduction, this thoroughly revised second edition includes more fully developed section introductions, updated and expanded bibliographies, and up-to-date classroom questions. The book is arranged topically around such issues as class, racism, gender/sexuality, language and literacy, and classroom issues for ease of usage and navigation. In addition, two entirely new sections focused on teacher education and critical issues beyond the classroom provide readers with the all-important tools needed to put critical pedagogical theory into practice in their own classrooms. Carefully attentive to both theory and practice, this new edition remains the definitive source for teaching and learning about critical pedagogy.</p></p><p><p>Antonia Darder is Professor of Educational Policy Studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. </p> <p></p> <p>Marta P.

It was not until I found <em>The Critical Pedagogy Reader</em> that I was satisfied. The editors have managed to not only trace the fine historical points and lineages of critical pedagogy, but have compiled a group of articles covering all the gender, class, language, access, race, ethnicity, existential, and classroom concerns that critical pedagogues must address every day.

But when a new minister, John Meredith, comes to town with his own four youngsters in tow, things get very boisterous indeed. Together, the Blythe and Meredith children hatch schemes in their own private hideout--a hollow they call Rainbow Valley. There, they plot to rescue a young runaway named Mary Vance, and even form the Good-Conduct Club so the Meredith children can redeem themselves in the eyes of the disapproving townspeople.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But their grandest and most important scheme centers around poor widowed John Meredith himself, who has surprised everyone by falling in love once more.

She worked for a time as a teacher and a journalist, then wrote her first novel, <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, in the evenings while caring for her grandmother. When the book appeared in 1908, it was an instant success; it would go on to sell millions of copies in dozens of languages the world over, making Anne one of literature's most beloved characters of all time.</p><h2>What Moves at the Margin: Selected Nonfiction</h2><p><p><i>What Moves at the Margin</i> collects three decades of Toni Morrison's writings about her work, her life, literature, and American society. The works included in this volume range from 1971, when Morrison (b. 1931) was a new editor at Random House and a beginning novelist, to 2002 when she was a professor at Princeton University and Nobel Laureate. Even in the early days of her career, in between editing other writers, writing her own novels, and raising two children, she found time to speak out on subjects that mattered to her. From the reviews and essays written for major publications to her moving tributes to other writers to the commanding acceptance speeches for major literary awards, Morrison has consistently engaged as a writer outside the margins of her fiction. These works provide a unique glimpse into Morrison's viewpoint as an observer of the world, the arts, and the changing landscape of American culture. </p><p>The first section of the book, "Family and History," includes Morrison's writings about her family, Black women, Black history, and her own works. The second section, "Writers and Writing," offers her assessments of writers she admires and books she reviewed, edited at Random House, or gave a special affirmation to with a foreword or an introduction. The final section, "Politics and Society," includes essays and speeches where Morrison addresses issues in American society and the role of language and literature in the national culture. </p><p>Among other pieces, this collection includes a reflection on 9/11, reviews of such seminal books by Black writers as Albert Murray's <i>South to a Very Old Place</i> and Gayl Jones's <i>Corregidora</i>, an essay on teaching moral values in the university, a eulogy for James Baldwin, and Morrison's Nobel lecture.

She is an Irish citizen and lives in Dublin.<br>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>See a tall man pacing alone on the twilight beach, caught between the dying day and the incoming tide. Smell the moist air, heavy with salt. Hear the lapping of waves slapping the shore, the hiss of their withdrawal, their rushing return. Tide flirting with sand, seducing, inviting, whispering tales from beyond the dark sea.<br>Dark sea, fading light, and an old familiar restlessness combined to haunt Amergin the bard. All his life he had suffered an itch in his soul, a formless yearning that blew toward him on the north wind. The green wind, he named it to himself, for to Amergin it seemed laden with verdant aromas from some fair otherworld existing only in his imagination. Yet the north wind persisted in torturing him with hints of that achingly beautiful and unreal land, his heart&#x2019;s home.<br>Amergin had never felt truly at home anywhere, even inside his own skin. Tonight the mood was particularly strong, driving him to stalk the beach and endure his melancholy with gritted teeth.<br>For once Clarsah did not ride his shoulder. Evening wind off the sea could damage the voice of a harp. But in a way Clarsah was always with him, for she was an intimate part of the man, her music constantly in his thoughts. In the gradually deepening twilight he began trying to capture the essence of the songs he heard on the wind and shape them to fit the harp&#x2019;s capabilities.<br>But tonight the ocean seemed to be a sentient presence, willfully intruding on his efforts at composition. He found himself gazing toward the horizon again and again, as if he expected to see...what? Some goddess shaped from waves and foam to dispel his loneliness?<br>Lust flickered through Amergin, random as heat lightning.<br>He shook his head, wryly amused at himself. Even a druid&#x2019;s vision could not see a goddess where none existed, or summon the spirit of the ocean herself and clothe her in flesh for his pleasure. Druid vision, like druid talent, was a sometime thing, not under a man&#x2019;s control. Its occurrence and usage were chosen by the spirits for their own communication. Amergin, bard and druid, understood this all too well.<br>Yet Amergin the man still longed to grasp his elusive gift firmly and use it, somehow, to shape something better...<br>He paused and bent to strip off his sandals, knotting their thongs together so he could sling them over his shoulder. He had an urge to walk barefoot and let the damp, sunwarmed sand ooze between his toes.<br>He watched a lace of foam run up the beach and skitter back, glowing with hoarded luminosity. What was the source of such light and how was it held? he wondered. The tide painted serpentines on the sand and he bent to study them, curious to know what artisan had designed such graceful patterns and taught the sea to reproduce them. Amergin felt the glamour of a mystery beyond even druid knowledge and wished there were someone to whom he could express his thoughts. But he was singularly alone.<br>When he was a small child, enthusiasm had bubbled up in him like a wellspring and he reached out to everyone, trying to touch, eager to share. Each new discovery of beauty or wonder delighted the young Amergin almost beyond bearing. But when he tugged at the nearest arm&#x2014;&#x201c;Look, oh, <i>look</i>!&#x201d;&#x2014;his clanspeople pulled away impatiently, or offered him the polite patronization adults substitute for interest. The assumed the little boy&#x2019;s excitement would fade when the spirit newly housed in his body grew accustomed to the world around it.<br>But for Amergin that never happened. The rebuff of busy adults drove him back behind a shield of shyness, hiding his vulnerability. He learned the lesson early: if you cared too much, if you opened yourself too far, you got hurt.<br>Among the garrulous Gaelicians he became notable for his quietness. His brothers teased him unmercifully for a time, accusing him of having been born with his jaws locked together. When he endured their taunts with unfailing good humor they at last quit teasing the little boy and went in search of more responsive targets.<br>Many seasons would pass before the great spirit demanded that Amergin fight free of self-consciousness and speak up boldly, risking rejection and misunderstanding. Life forces weakness to give way to strength; it is the Law.<br>Now, as a trained bard, he still recalled the intensity of those early emotions and longed to communicate them to others, to bring to life with his poetry radiant realms transcending mere survival. His soul was nourished by beauty; his spirit was drawn to mystery. A bard&#x2019;s art must somehow harness both.<br>The task was not easy. There were dark days when he sweated and struggled and swore over one slippery phrase that would not come right; sleepless nights when he feared his skill would never equal his desire. Last night had been sleepless and today had seemed dark, though the summer sun shone. Still Amergin sensed the brooding weight of a storm beyond the rim of the world, heightening his restlessness, driving him to prowl the beach and...<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he cried aloud, startled. He froze in midstride, staring northward beyond the sea, beyond the rim of the world. An urgent summons came winging to him on the green wind, shocking him like a lightning bolt. A powerful presence...not imagined but unbearably real!...was calling to him, reaching out to him from beyond the farthest horizon.<br>He could not move except to lift his arms in reply, stretching them wordlessly as he stared transfixed beyond limits of human vision. No seafoam goddess, this, created from restlessness and the body&#x2019;s fever-dreams; whatever called Amergin was irresistibly alive and as compelling as the tide.<br>His soul rose into his throat, acing to answer.<br>The bard was so intent on whatever beckoned from beyond the ninth wave that he was blind to the sea before him. Yet at last his brain forced him to recognize objects his eyes had been ignoring. Ships.<br><i>A fleet</i>!<br>Their intruding reality shattered the spell and he found himself staring in disbelief at a line of merchant galleys, battered and beaten, limping toward the harbor beyond the headland.<br>Amergin could hardly believe he was seeing traders arriving again after so many seasons. He rubbed his eyes but when he looked again the ships were still there, struggling closer. The oars swam through air and water in a ragged rhythm betraying the weariness of the oarsmen. The vessels seemed close to foundering in increasingly heavy surf.<br>The bard gasped and began to run. He must reach a point where he could wade into the sea and pull out survivors if the galleys went onto the rocks; failing that, he would have to get to his clan&#x2019;s stronghold on the headland as quickly as possible and summon help. There was suddenly so much to do and so little time!<br>Yet even as he ran, anger ran with him. The traders were coming at the most inopportune time for him. Their arrival had broken a vital connection between Amergin and whatever it was that called him on the green wind, and it hurt.<br>It hurt terribly.<br>* * *<br>The source of the green wind was far to the north. The current of living air lay like a broad band across the sea, stretching from Amergin&#x2019;s coast all the way to a large island of mountains and meadows and sweetwatered rivers.<br>Water, water, running water. Shinann was always drawn to the sound of running water, water going somewhere. Somewhere in the past or the future, perhaps, and time a stream you could wade into and then step out of on any curve of the bank you chose.<br>So the teachers had taught.<br>The sun had dropped below the rim of the world but the sky was still as filled with light as a plum with juice. The woman loitered along the riverbank, lifting her skirts to her things and wading into the shallows, kicking the water playfully to make it pronounce her name, &#x201c;Shi-<i>nahn</i>, Shi-<i>nahn</i>,&#x201d; for the golden gorse on the opposite bank.<br>The small woman paused and cocked her head, listening. She thought she heard an echo of something other than the voice of the river, a sound like that of a stringed instrument. The wind harping through the trees, perhaps. Yet the music it made was like none she knew, with a compelling quality that drew her to seek its source, calling out to the unseen musician. Looking southward, she waded deeper into the water, stepping confidently, very much in her element. Water water, running water.<br>And sudden sharp pain! Something hidden in the riverbottom ooze slashed her bare foot and Shinann jerked back, shocked that a river would attach her without provocation.<br>She clambered onto the nearest bank, dragging her skirts through a mass of reeds. Settling down crosslegged, she examined her injury in the fading light. Along her instep was a raggedly deep cut, welling blood.<br>Shinann frowned in concentration. The bleeding stopped.<br>She was a small woman, slender, with pale coppery hair streaming over her shoulders. Her eyes were the color of clear water. She was dressed in a soft robe caught around the waist with a twisted rope that glittered. Perhaps the rope was woven gold. Perhaps not.<br>A little woman with a curiosity out of all proportion to her size, Shinann had a questing nature that sent her back into the water in search of her attacker. She crouched down until only her head was above the surface, hair floating around her face like the petals of some fantastic flower. Then she took a deep breath and ducked to grope in the mud.<br>Her fingers closed on a shape alien to the natural debris of a watercourse. She worried the thing free and carried it to the riverbank. The last daylight revealed a bronze dagger nearly long enough to be called a shortsword, nicked and pitted but still radiating a palpable viciousness. The blade had been rippled in the forging to make an ugly would going in, and an uglier would coming out.<br>Shinann flung the thing aside while she wrung the water out of her gown. Then she picked it up again and examined it with interest, turning it over and over in her hands. Looking around, she caught sight of a lichen-covered boulder and struck the dagger a sharp blow against the stone, deftly calculating the exact point at which the blade could be snapped from the hilt.<br>The weapon broke apart with a loud crack and Shinann grinned like a mischievous child.<br>Holding the rippled blade balanced between her thumb and forefinger, she tipped her head back and sighted along an invisible are, then hurled the weapon with all her strength. She watched it tumble through the air, silhouetted against the evening sky for a long distance until at last it fell and was lost in a tangle of briars.<br>Shinann then turned her attention to the dagger hilt. The bronze had been shaped to fit a man&#x2019;s grasp and decorated with an elaborate inlay of wide brass wire. Using her fingernails, she worked the wire free. The metal curled itself into a gleaming tendril in the palm of her hand. Shinann patiently through her bodice. Beauty made her smile.<br>The wind was blowing harder now. She stood on the riverbank, listening again, but heard no trace of the mysterious music. Its absence filled her with longing. She held out both her arms, reaching across empty space. Then she shrugged, feeling a little foolish.<br>Tossing her hair out of her eyes, Shinann headed away from the river, toward the Gathering Place.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1984 Morgan Llywelyn</p><h2>National Geographic Kids Ultimate Weatherpedia: The most complete weather reference ever</h2><p><b>What's the weather?

From proven leadership strategies to methods for maintaining high morale, this book discusses individual and group management techniques and how to carry out the various responsibilities of the supervisor. A variety of issues are explored, from hiring and training, to discipline and evaluation.

The relationships involved in individual and group management methods and the practical techniques for carrying out the various responsibilities of the supervisor are explored. Everyday problems faced by the police supervisor in interpersonal, operational, and administrative relationships with subordinates are also covered in detail.Preface <p> Recognizing that the first-line supervisor plays an indispensable role in the enforcement of American law, and that a straightforward book dealing with the responsibilities of supervisors and the most effective methods of fulfilling these responsibilities was needed, the author wrote the first edition of Supervision of Police Personnel in 1970. Four subsequent editions have followed during the ensuing three decades. With the beginning of the new millennium, the author's brother, Marvin D. Iannone, has joined in the writing of this sixth edition. </p><p> During their long law enforcement careers&#x2014;a combined total of 100 years&#x2014;both authors realized (and have had this realization confirmed countless times) that certain tenets of the first-line supervisor remain inviolable and that one cannot supervise effectively without an appreciation of these tenets. These time-tested principles include the following:</p><p>Although a supervisor is a manager, he must first think of himself as a leader. Indeed, one cannot be a leader without followers. A first-line supervisor is a part of those whom he leads, while at the same time being apart from them. In such a role, he must represent the rank and file to senior management and simultaneously represent senior management to the rank and file. When supervising, he must practice the Golden Rule. He must earn, not demand the respect of others. He must set the highest example.He must without exception be consistent and fair. His honor and professionalism must always be beyond reproach. </p><p> It is the authors' conviction that a supervisor, experienced or inexperienced, who applies the principles and techniques outlined in this book while using the foregoing tenets as an ever-present backdrop will be well on his way toward actualizing his greatest potential. </p><p> This edition has been updated to be consistent with changes in the law and the currently preferred practices of progressive police organizations. </p><p> The authors sincerely express their gratitude to all those professionals in law enforcement for their many contributions to the preparation of this book, and we are particularly grateful to all who have had such a profound influence on our professional and personal lives. We also thank the following reviewers: Alvin Berndt, Criminal Justice Institute; Michael Buerger, Northeastern University; Alan Mentzer, Truckee Meadows Community College; and Alan Marston, South Maine Technical College. </p><p> Our special thanks to Clara and Patricia for their never-ending support and patience.</p><p>Nathan lannone<br> Marvin lannone</p></p><h2>Temporary Monuments: Work by Rosemary Mayer, 1977-1982</h2><p><p>Rosemary Mayer (1943&#x2013;2014) was a prolific artist, writer, and critic, who entered the New York art scene in the late 1960s. By the early 1970s, she became known both for her large-scale fabric sculptures&#x2015;inspired by the lives of historical women&#x2015;and her involvement in the feminist art movement. As the decade progressed, Mayer gravitated away from sculpture as a fixed form and the gallery as the primary setting for experiencing art. In 1977, she began to create ephemeral outdoor installations using materials such as balloons, snow, paper, and fabric. Mayer called these projects "temporary monuments," and she intended for them to celebrate and memorialize individuals and communities through their connections to place, time, and nature. <i>Temporary Monuments: Work by Rosemary Mayer, 1977�&#x2013;1982</i>&nbsp;is the first comprehensive presentation of this body of work and includes Mayer's documentation of these impermanent artworks. Mayer created photographs, writings, artists' books, and drawings that expand the realm of these projects and reflect her interest in exploring ideas through a variety of media. An introductory essay by Gillian Sneed situates Mayer within the New York art world of the 1970s and &#x2018;80s and argues that Mayer's public art anticipated more recent practices of site-specific and socially engaged art.</p></p><p></p><h2>Killing for Coal: America&#x2019;s Deadliest Labor War</h2><p><p>On a spring morning in 1914, in the stark foothills of southern Colorado, members of the United Mine Workers of America clashed with guards employed by the Rockefeller family, and a state militia beholden to Colorado&#x2019;s industrial barons. When the dust settled, nineteen men, women, and children among the miners&#x2019; families lay dead. The strikers had killed at least thirty men, destroyed six mines, and laid waste to two company towns. </p><p><i>Killing for Coal</i> offers a bold and original perspective on the 1914 Ludlow Massacre and the &#x201c;Great Coalfield War.&#x201d; In a sweeping story of transformation that begins in the coal beds and culminates with the deadliest strike in American history, Thomas Andrews illuminates the causes and consequences of the militancy that erupted in colliers&#x2019; strikes over the course of nearly half a century. He reveals a complex world shaped by the connected forces of land, labor, corporate industrialization, and workers&#x2019; resistance.</p><p>Brilliantly conceived and written, this book takes the organic world as its starting point. The resulting elucidation of the coalfield wars goes far beyond traditional labor history. Considering issues of social and environmental justice in the context of an economy dependent on fossil fuel, Andrews makes a powerful case for rethinking the relationships that unite and divide workers, consumers, capitalists, and the natural world.</p></p><p>Thomas G. Andrews is Associate Professor of History at the University of Colorado Boulder.The Ludlow Massacre of 1914 has long been known as one of the most notorious events in all of American labor history, but until the publication of <i>Killing for Coal</i>, it was still possible to see this slaughter simply as an episode in the history of American industrial violence. In Thomas Andrews's skilled hands, it becomes something much subtler, more complicated, and revealing: a window onto the profound transformation of work and environment that occurred on the Western mining frontier in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Anyone interested in the history of labor, the environment, and the American West will want to read this book. (William Cronon, author of <i>Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West</i>)<br><br><i>Killing for Coal</i> is a stunning achievement. Beautifully written and masterfully researched, it stands as the definitive history of the dramatic events at Ludlow and breaks new ground in our understanding of industrialization and the environment. If I were to pick one word to describe this book, I would say, "powerful." (Kathryn Morse, author of <i>The Nature of Gold: An Environmental History of the Klondike Gold Rush</i>)<br><br><i>Killing for Coal</i> arises from the rare and providential convergence of an extraordinary author and an extraordinary topic. With a perfect instinct for the telling detail, Thomas Andrews wields a matching talent for conveying, in crystal-clear prose, the deepest meanings of history. This is, in every sense, an illuminating book, shining light into a dark terrain of the American past and of the human soul. (Patricia Nelson Limerick, author of <i>The Legacy of Conquest: The Unbroken Past of the American West</i>)<br><br>A groundbreaking work about coal and coal development, labor relations and class conflict. (Sandra Dallas <i>Denver Post</i> 2009-02-15)<br><br>Thomas G. Andrews' <i>Killing for Coal</i> offers an intriguing analysis of the so-called Ludlow Massacre of April 20, 1914, a watershed event in American labor history that he illuminates with a new understanding of the complexity of this conflict...<i>Killing for Coal</i> distinguishes itself from conventional labor histories, by going beyond sociological factors to look at the total physical environment--what Andrews calls the "workscape"--and the role it played in the lives of both labor and management...In its deft marriage of natural and social history, <i>Killing for Coal</i> sets a new standard for how the history of industry can and should be written. (Emily F. Popek <i>PopMatters</i> 2009-01-30)<br><br>A stunning debut, full of insight into the role of labor and class not just in southern Colorado, but across the country. (<i>Denver Westword</i> 2009-03-27)<br><br>Andrews brings a 21st-century approach to this once-troubled landscape where the region's voracious need for fuel trumped the rights and independence of the men who dragged it out of the ground. (Bob Hoover <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> 2009-04-19)<br><br><i>Killing for Coal</i> is far more than a blow-by-blow account of America's deadliest labor war. It is an environmental history that seeks to explain strike violence as the natural excretion of an industry that brutalized the earth and the men who worked beneath it. Andrews is one of the excellent young scholars who have given new life to the field of labor and working-class studies by introducing new questions about race and gender, ethnicity and nationality, and new insights drawn from anthropology and physical geography...Andrews deserves credit for writing one of the best books ever published on the mining industry and its environmental impact and for drawing more public attention to the Ludlow story and its significance. (James Green <i>Dissent</i> 2009-05-01)<br><br>Andrews does an excellent job of placing the massacre in the larger context of both previous labor strife in the area and the violent reprisals that armed bands of miners launched on mine owners, strikebreakers, and militia men in response to the deaths at Ludlow. One of the great strengths of Andrews's account is his integration of environmental history into his narrative at all levels, and not just as an afterthought. The book is as much a history of coal, coal mining, and the reshaping of Colorado's environment as it is a history of the Great Coalfield War of 1914. (A. M.

Considering evil from the perspective of the perpetrator, Baumeister attempts to understand how otherwise seemingly decent people come to participate in evil acts. He contends that many of our attitudes about evil especially our belief in the myth of pure evil have greatly hindered our ability to deal with today&#39;s problems of violence, oppression, and suffering. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>Roy F. Baumeister, Ph.D. holds the E. B. Smith Professorship in Liberal Arts at Case Western Reserve University.In this open-minded, provocative, unsettling inquiry into the causes of evil, Baumeister rejects the entrenched view that low self-esteem causes violence and aggression. On the contrary, he argues, violent or evil people tend to have highly favorable opinions of themselves, and cross the line to commit immoral, hurtful acts when they feel their egotism is threatened by others. Among the root causes of evil he identifies are ambition, desire for power or wealth, misplaced idealistic adherence to a creed or doctrine and sadistic pleasure. He applies this framework, with varying degrees of persuasiveness, to an analysis of diverse evils: murder, rape, street crime, war, petty cruelty, emotional abuse, wife beating, government repression, racial and ethnic hatreds. A social psychologist at Case Western Reserve University, Baumeister believes that evil grows and spreads when cultures stop restraining individuals' angry, violent impulses?a process abetted by desensitization, yearnings for revenge, group conformity and inadequate socialization or upbringing. His rewarding study challenges?and complements?traditional, religion-based views of evil with a humanistic perspective.

Among her books are <i>Machines Who Think</i>, a history of artificial intelligence; <i>The Universal Machine</i>, a study of the worldwide impact of the computer; and <i>Aaron&#x2019;s Code</i>, an inquiry into the future of art and artificial intelligence. Her work has been translated into all the major European and Asian languages. A recent book, coauthored with Nancy Ramsey, is <i>The Futures of Women</i> (Addison-Wesley, 1996; Time-Warner paperback, 1997), containing four scenarios for women worldwide in the year 2015. <p>Ms. McCorduck has been an active member of PEN American Center, the author organization in New York City, serving on its executive board and as vice president for several years. In addition, she founded and chaired PEN&#x2019;s Readers and Writers Program, which sends authors and their books to newly literate adults all over the country. She has been a board member and treasurer of the New Mexico Committee of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and currently serves on its advisory committee. Ms. McCorduck also works as a consultant, constructing future scenarios for firms in the transportation, financial, and high-tech sectors.</p>The review you are reading was written by a human, not a machine. This fact would no doubt disappoint some of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, who would have thought that by the 21st century a computer would be able to read a book, consider it in the context of other knowledge and express some thoughtful opinions about it. On the other hand, the human who wrote this review was aided in researching and preparing it by telecommunications and computer networks, including the Internet, that owe a big part of their existence &#x2014;and even more of their smooth functioning&#x2014;to theories and concepts that arose from artificial-intelligence research. The enormous, if stealthy, influence of AI bears out many of the wonders foretold 25 years ago in Machines Who Think, Pamela McCorduck&#x2019;s groundbreaking survey of the history and prospects of the field. A novelist at the time (she has since gone on to write and consult widely on the intellectual impact of computing), McCorduck got to the founders of the field while they were still feeling their way into a new science. Her novelist&#x2019;s eye for detail and ear for style formed a book that this magazine&#x2019;s review of the first edition described as "delicious." When Machines Who Think was first published in 1979, it was an up-to-the-moment history. But in a digital world, that moment was an eternity ago, so McCorduck has appended a 30,000-word afterword to bring the reader up-to-date. The original text has been wisely left unaltered (including a few passages that now seem quaint, such as the explanation of the difference between hardware and software). Her story begins long before the advent of computing, in ancient thinking about the human need to make something in our own image. McCorduck sees AI research as the continuation of a long tradition of thought, encompassing everything from the Ten Commandments&#x2019; prohibition against idols to Mary Shelley and her Frankenstein monster. But the book, like the field, really doesn&#x2019;t begin to take off until computing machines&#x2014;mechanical at first, then eventually digital&#x2014;enter the picture. McCorduck details the thoughts of theorists such as Alan Turing (who believed machine intelligence was possible) and John von Neumann (who didn&#x2019;t) and devotes considerable space to work on chess- and checkers-playing machines, which was the early public face of AI. She notes seminal events, particularly the Dartmouth Conference, a 1956 workshop where much of the groundwork for future research was laid by such men as Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and two upstarts who would be hugely influential, Alan Newell and Herbert Simon. Newell and Simon were in large part responsible for a shift in thinking away from the idea that machine intelligence must mimic the brain physically, an approach that drew parallels between neurons and digital devices, and toward the view that it should simulate human thought processes&#x2014;what became known as the information-processing model. McCorduck shows how this idea developed over the years, how problems that were first seen as "impossibly nonmechanical" were solved and how these solutions "slowly began to be brought into the domain of ordinary computational processes." That slow infusion of AI into everyday computing picked up speed after 1979, and in the afterword McCorduck gives a taste of these advances and of recent research in robotics, natural-language processing and other fields that are, in essence, AI spin-offs. This part of the book feels sketchy, and the author acknowledges that it is not meant as a definitive survey of the field&#x2019;s past 25 years. But the reader is left wanting more. Still, taken together, the original and the afterword form a rich and fascinating history. Along the way, McCorduck introduces us to some interesting characters, not the least of whom are the naysayers. She devotes a chapter to Hubert Dreyfus, the philosopher who in the 1960s became a thorn in the side of researchers with his public pronouncements about the futility of their work (they had the last laugh, however, when a machine beat him at chess). And she writes about those thinkers, most recently the technologist Bill Joy, for whom the great hopes of AI have been replaced by great fears, of machines that might rule rather than rival humans. The book is described as a "personal inquiry," and now, as then, McCorduck leaves little doubt as to where her personal allegiance lies. From the title to the very last sentence, she is a believer in what she calls a "heroic enterprise." She may admit that researchers have a long way to go, but she dismisses the doubters as well: AI, she writes, is "neither the field of dreams nor the field of nightmares portrayed." Were she to produce a 50th-anniversary edition in 2029, she might be somewhat surprised, but surely very pleased, to see it reviewed by a machine who thinks. <p><i>Henry Fountain is a writer and editor at the New York Times, specializing in science and technology.</i></p></p><h2>Pictures of Nothing: Abstract Art since Pollock (The A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 48)</h2><p><p>"What is abstract art good for? What's the use--for us as individuals, or for any society--of pictures of nothing, of paintings and sculptures or prints or drawings that do not seem to show anything except themselves?" In this invigorating account of abstract art since Jackson Pollock, eminent art historian Kirk Varnedoe, the former chief curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, asks these and other questions as he frankly confronts the uncertainties we may have about the nonrepresentational art produced in the last five decades. He makes a compelling argument for its history and value, much as E. H. Gombrich tackled representation fifty years ago in <i>Art and Illusion</i>, another landmark A. W. Mellon Lectures volume. Realizing that these lectures might be his final work, Varnedoe conceived of them as a statement of his faith in modern art and as the culminating example of his lucidly pragmatic and philosophical approach to art history. He delivered the lectures, edited and reproduced here with their illustrations, to overflowing crowds at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in the spring of 2003, just months before his death.</p><br><p> With brilliance, passion, and humor, Varnedoe addresses the skeptical attitudes and misunderstandings that we often bring to our experience of abstract art. Resisting grand generalizations, he makes a deliberate and scholarly case for abstraction--showing us that more than just pure looking is necessary to understand the self-made symbolic language of abstract art. Proceeding decade by decade, he brings alive the history and biography that inform the art while also challenging the received wisdom about distinctions between abstraction and representation, modernism and postmodernism, and minimalism and pop. The result is a fascinating and ultimately moving tour through a half century of abstract art, concluding with an unforgettable description of one of Varnedoe's favorite works.</p></p><p><p>"Varnedoe was an especially distinguished and influential curator and interpreter of modern art, and this book, in effect, is his last testament. It is in the analysis of specific works of art or bodies of work by a specific artist that Varnedoe shines, reflecting his long career of intimate study of art objects. He is commenting on some of the most challenging of artists, the likes of Richard Serra, Cy Twombly, Jasper Johns, and other innovators in abstraction of various kinds. There are some truly refreshing moments where Varnedoe has the courage of his convictions and explains why one artist of merit should receive more of our attention than another artist of merit-in effect, distinguishing between greater and lesser merit, rather than just good or bad."<b>--Richard Shiff, University of Texas</b></p><b>Kirk Varnedoe</b>(1946-2003) was Professor of Art History at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton from 2001 until his death.

Standing in the doorway I breathed in the sweet scent of day lilies, gladiolas, roses and lavender from Susannah's Garden, the flower shop next door.<br><br>It was the beginning of summer, and although the sky was overcast and rain threatened to fall at any moment, the sun shone brightly in my heart. (My husband, Brad, always laughs when I say things like that. But I don't care. As a woman who's survived cancer not once but twice, I feel entitled to the occasional sentimental remark. Especially today...)<br><br>I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, enjoying the early-morning peace. I just don't think there's anyplace more beautiful than Seattle in the summer. All the flowers spilling out of Susannah's Garden are one of the benefits. The array of colors, as well as the heady perfume drifting in my direction, makes me so glad A Good Yarn is located where it is.<br><br>Whiskers, my shop cat, as Brad calls him, ambled across the hardwood floor and leaped into the window display, nestling among the skeins of pastel yarns. He takes up residence there most days and has long been a neighborhood favorite. The apartment upstairs is an extra storeroom for yarn at the moment; perhaps one day I'll rent it out again but that isn't in the plans yet.<br><br>The French Caf� across the street was already busy, as it is every morning. The windows were filled with pastries, breads and croissants warm from the oven, and their delectable aroma added to the scents I associate with summer on Blossom Street. Alix Turner is usually there by five to bake many of these wonderful temptations. She's one of my dearest friends&#x2014;and was among my first customers. I'm so proud of everything she's accomplished in the past few years. It's fair to say she reinvented her life&#x2014;with a little help from her friends. She has an education and a career now, and she's married to a man who seems completely right for her.<br><br>Blossom Street Books down the street was ready for business, too. Anne Marie Roche and her staff often leave the front door open as a welcoming gesture, inviting those who wander past to come inside and browse. She and her daughter, Ellen, would be coming home from Paris later today.<br><br>Nearly every afternoon Ellen walks their Yorkie past the window so Whiskers and Baxter can stare fiercely at each other. Ellen insists it's all for show, that the cat and dog are actually good friends but don't want any of us to know that.<br><br>I grinned at Whiskers because I couldn't resist sharing my joy and excitement&#x2014;even with the cat. In fact, I wanted to tell the whole world my news. Yesterday, we found out that we'd been approved for adoption. I hadn't yet shared this information with anyone, including my sister, Margaret. We've been through the interviews, the home test and fingerprinting. And last night we heard.<br><br>We're going to adopt a baby.<br><br>Because of my cancer, pregnancy is out of the question. While the ability to conceive has been taken from me, the desire for a baby hasn't. It's like an ache that never quite goes away. As much as possible I've tried to hide this from Brad. Whenever thoughts of what cancer has stolen from me enter my head, I try hard to counter them by remembering all the blessings I've received in my life. I want to celebrate every day, savor every minute, without resentment or regret.<br><br>I have so much for which to be grateful. I'm alive and cancer-free. I'm married to a man I adore. His son, Cody, now nine years old, has become my son, too. And I have a successful business, one that brings me great pleasure and satisfaction. When I first opened A Good Yarn, it was my way of shouting to the world that I refused to let cancer rob me of anything else. I was going to <em>live </em>and I was going to do it without the constant threat of illness and death. I was determined to bask in the sunshine. I still am.<br><br>So A Good Yarn was the start of my new life. Within a year of opening the store, I met Brad Goetz and we were married the following spring. Because of what I'd been through in my teens and again in my twenties, I didn't have a lot of experience with men or relationships. At first, Brad's love terrified me. Then I learned not to reject something good just because I was afraid of its loss. I learned that I could trust this man&#x2014;and myself.<br><br>How blessed I am to be loved by him and Cody. Each and every day I thank God for the two men in my life.<br><br>Even with all I have, my arms ached to hold a baby. <em>Our </em>baby. Brad, who knows me so well, understood my need. After discussing the subject for weeks on end, after vacillating, weighing the pros and cons, we'd reached our decision.<br><br>Yes, we were going to adopt.<br><br>The catalyst for all this happened when Anne Marie Roche adopted eight-year-old Ellen.<br><br>I realized the wait for a newborn might be lengthy but we were both prepared for that. Although we'd be thrilled with an infant of either sex, I secretly longed for a little girl.<br><br>I heard the back door close and turned to see my sister, Margaret. She's worked with me almost from the first day I opened the shop. Although we're as different as any two sisters could be, we've become close. Margaret is a good balance for me, ever practical and pragmatic, and I think I balance her, too, since I'm much more optimistic and given to occasional whimsy.<br><br>"Good morning!" I greeted her cheerfully, unable to disguise my happiness.<br><br>"It's going to pour," she muttered, taking off her raincoat and hanging it in the back storeroom.<br><br>My sister tends to see the negative. The glass would always be half-empty to Margaret. Or completely empty&#x2014;if not shattered on the floor. Over the years I've grown accustomed to her attitude and simply ignore it.<br><br>When she'd finished removing her coat, Margaret stared at me, then frowned. "Why are <em>you </em>so happy?" she demanded. "Anybody can see we're about to have a downpour."<br><br>"Me? Happy?" There wasn't much point in trying to hold back my news, even though I knew Margaret was the one person who wouldn't understand my pleasure. She'd disapprove and would have no qualms about imparting her opinion. It's her pessimistic nature, I suppose, and the fact that she worries about me, although she'd never admit that.<br><br>Margaret continued to glare. "You're grinning from ear to ear."<br><br>I made busy work at the cash register in order to avoid eye contact. I might as well tell her, although I dreaded her response. "Brad and I have applied for adoption," I blurted out, unable to stop myself. "And our application's been accepted."<br><br>A startled silence followed.<br><br>"I know you think we're making a mistake," I rushed to add.<br><br>"I didn't say that." Margaret walked slowly toward me.<br><br>"You didn't need to <em>say </em>anything," I told her. Just once I wanted Margaret to be happy for me, without doubts and objections and concerns. "Your silence said it all."<br><br>Margaret joined me at the counter next to the cash register. She seemed to sense that her reaction had hurt me. "I'm only wondering if adoption's a wise choice for you."<br><br>"Margaret," I began, sighing as I spoke. "Brad and I know what we're doing." Although Margaret hadn't said it openly, I could guess what concerned her most. She was afraid the cancer would return. I'm well aware of the possibility and have been ever since its recurrence ten years ago. It was a serious consideration and one that neither Brad nor I took lightly.<br><br>"Brad agrees?" My sister sounded skeptical.<br><br>"Of course he agrees! I'd never go against his wishes."<br><br>Margaret still didn't look convinced. "You're <em>sure </em>this is what you want?"<br><br>"Yes." I was adamant. Sometimes that's the only way to reach her. "Brad knows the risks as well as I do. You don't need to spell it out, Margaret. I understand why you're afraid for me, but I'm through with living in fear."<br><br>Margaret's eyes revealed her apprehensions. She studied me and after a moment asked, "What if the adoption agency doesn't find you a child?"<br><br>This was something Brad and I had discussed and it could certainly happen. I shrugged. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. We'll take the chance."<br><br>"You want an infant?"<br><br>"Yes." I pictured a newborn, wrapped in a soft pink blanket, gently placed in my waiting arms. I held on to the image, allowing it to bring me comfort, to fill me with hope.<br><br>To my surprise Margaret didn't immediately voice another objection. After a thoughtful minute or two, she said in low tones, "You'd be a good mother... you already are."<br><br>I'm sure my jaw fell open. The shock of Margaret's endorsement was almost more than I could take in. This was as close as Margaret had ever come to bestowing her approval on anything regarding my personal life. No, that wasn't fair. She'd been partially responsible for Brad and me getting back together when I'd pushed him away&#x2014;a reconciliation that led directly to our marriage.<br><br>"Thank you," I whispered and touched her arm.<br><br>Margaret made some gruff, unintelligible reply and moved to the table at the back of the store. She pulled out a chair, sat down and took out her crocheting.<br><br>"I put up the poster you made for our new class," I told her, doing my best to conceal the emotion that crept into my voice. The last thing I'd expected from Margaret had been her blessing, and I was deeply touched by her words.<br><br>She acknowledged my comment with a nod.<br><br></p><h2>God Is Not Nice: Rejecting Pop Culture Theology and Discovering the God Worth Living For</h2><p>Ulrich L. Lehner reintroduces Christians to the true God&#x2014;not the polite, easygoing, divine therapist who doesn&#x2019;t ask much of us, but the Almighty God who is unpredictable, awe-inspiring, and demands our entire lives.&nbsp; Stripping away the niceties with a sling blade, Lehner shows that God is more strange and beautiful than we imagine, and wants to know and transform us in the most intimate way.<br><br> With his iconoclastic new book <i>God Is Not Nice</i>, Lehner, one of the most promising young Catholic theologians in America, challenges the God of popular culture and many of our churches and reintroduces the God of the Bible and traditional Christianity. As Lehner writes in the book&#x2019;s introduction, "We all need the vaccine of the true transforming and mysterious character of God: The God who shows up in burning bushes, speaks through donkeys, drives demons into pigs, throws Saul from his horse, and appears to St. Francis. It&#x2019;s only this God who has the power to challenge us, change us, and make our lives dangerous. He sweeps us into a great adventure that will make us into different people."<br><br> This book is not safe. It may startle and annoy many people&#x2014;including those who purport to teach and preach the Gospel, but are missing it, according to Lehner. <i>God Is Not Nice</i> intends to overthrow all of our popular misconceptions about God, inviting us to ask deeper questions about the nature of our lives and our relationship with him.<br><br> When you're finished with <i>God Is Not Nice</i>, you may find the idols you constructed in God&#x2019;s name smashed, replaced with a God who will ask you to live an entirely different life full of hope and transformation.<br><br><i>God Is Not Nice</i> has been translated into several foreign languages.</p><p><p><b>Ulrich L.

What started as a limited coup against the Huguenot leadership became instead a conflagration that left two thousand or more Protestants dead in the streets and ushered in a series of bloody religious battles. Until now, however, historians have been preoccupied with the political aspects of the conflicts, and histories have focused on the roles of the king and high noblemen in the assassinations that sparked the massacres, rather than the mass violence. In this compelling and unique study, Diefendorf closely examines popular religious fanaticism and religious hatred. She focuses on the roots and escalation of the conflicts, the propaganda of Catholic and Protestant preachers, popular religious beliefs and rituals, the role of the militia, and the underground activities of the Protestant community after the massacres. Drawing on a wide array of published and unpublished sources, <em>Beneath the Cross</em> is the most comprehensive social history to date of these religious conflicts.<br></p><p>Barbara B. Diefendorf is at Boston University."[T]his work immediately takes its place as the richest, most detailed study of the course of events within a single city during the early phases of the Wars of Religion....Diefendorf has explored to a particularly good narrative effect the unusually rich store of memoirs, journals, and<br>letters available about Paris....[This] is the first book to which students now ought to be referred if they want to understand the causes and nature of religious violence in the years leading up to those fateful days."--Archive for Reformation History<br><br>"The wider importance of the study lies in the conclusion that had it not been for the fierce Catholicism of the people of Paris, the Wars of Religion--so-called--would have taken a different course....The book adds a new dimension without claiming to supersede others."--The English Historical<br>Review<br><br>"Diefendorf has taken a step both bold and necessary in conducting and publishing serious research into confessional hatred and violence...This sensitive book broadens our understanding of a troubling subject; but it raises a host of comparative questions which need to be equally sensitively<br>addressed."--French History<br><br>"Combines careful documentation and rigorous analysis with a style of presentation that marks its author as a master storyteller....Embodies a rare combination of exacting scholarship nand compelling narrative."--Religious Studies Review<br><br>"A brilliant, original interpretation of the French Religious Wars that should be required reading for all historians of sixteenth-century France....Bound to provide fresh ideas and material for future debate."--Sixteenth Century Journal<br><br>"Wonderful book--the clearest and most persuasive that has been written on the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Night in Paris and its prelude.

Salmon, Bryn Mawr College<br><br>"Wonderful addition to the historiography on the French wars. It holds one's attention throughout."--Joan L. Coffey, Sam Houston State University "Very interesting book. I like her fresh approach to the religious and political crises of France from 1559 to 1572. Her understanding of<br>religious feeling and emotion as causation factors in historical crisis and change is a good antidote to economic determinism."--Col. James S. Wheeler, United States Military Academy<br><br>"Well-argued and engagingly written scholarly account of events that reached a crisis in the infamous massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. This is a valuable work in itself as well as a model of good historical thinking drawing on the best techniques of the profession."--John M.

In <i>The Twilight of American Culture,</i> Berman examined the internal factors of that decline, showing that they were identical to those of Rome in its late-empire phase. In <i>Dark Ages America,</i> he explored the external factors&#x2014;e.g., the fact that both empires were ultimately attacked from the outside&#x2014;and the relationship between the events of 9/11 and the history of U.S. foreign policy.</p> <ul> <li>In his most ambitious work to date, Berman looks at the "why" of it all</li> <li>Probes America's commitment to economic liberalism and free enterprise stretching back to the late sixteenth century, and shows how this ideology, along with that of technological progress, rendered any alternative marginal to American history</li> <li>Maintains, more than anything else, that this one-sided vision of the country's purpose finally did our nation in</li> </ul> <p><i>Why America Failed</i> is a controversial work, one that will shock, anger, and transform its readers. The book is a stimulating and provocative explanation of how we managed to wind up in our current situation: economically weak, politically passe, socially divided, and culturally adrift. It is a tour de force, a powerful conclusion to Berman's study of American imperial decline.</p></p><p><p>Praise for</p> <p>Why America Failed</p> <p>"Morris Berman is one of our most prescient and important social and cultural critics. He marries a laser-like intelligence with a deep moral core. His writing is as lucid and crisp as it is insightful.His newest book, Why America Failed, rips open the dark and dying carcass of empire.His analysis is sobering and often depressing .But the truth at this stage in the game is depressing, very depressing. Those who refuse to face this truth because it is unpleasant, because it does not inspire happy thoughts or offer false hope, are in flight from the real. The collective retreat into self-delusion has transformed huge swaths of the American populace into a peculiar species of adult-children who live in a Peter Pan world of make believe where reality is never permitted to be an impediment to desire. It is too bad Berman, who sees and writes about all this with a stunning clarity, lives in Mexico.It gets lonely up here."</p> <p>&#x2014;Chris Hedges, author of Death of the Liberal Class and Empire of Illusion</p> <p>"Morris Berman's masterpiece is a brutally honest, wonderfully crafted, exceptionally well-documented treatise on how America was spawned, several hundred years ago, to devour its offspring&#x2014;financially, socially, and technologically. Why America Failed shines a harsh, unavoidable light upon the cunning business mindset at the core of America's creation, expansion, and devolution. Berman describes with stunning clarity how and why the 'hustler' mentality, upon which our country was predicated, eviscerated alternative moral or social doctrines, and thus incorporated the seeds of our self-destruction from its very inception. This book is as uncomfortable to read as it is impossible to miss."</p> <p>&#x2014;Nomi Prins, author of It Takes a Pillage and Other People's Money</p> <p>"Morris Berman noticed that it's not morning in America anymore. His message may wake up the millions who are oversleeping while the late-day storm clouds gather over this land."</p> <p>&#x2014;James Howard Kunstler, author of The Long Emergency</p> <p>"As the decline of America's empire becomes both starker and gradually evident, nothing is more important than accessible analyses of the causes of that decline. Far too few such works exist because of the taboos against writing them. All the more welcome then is Morris Berman's clear, bluntly but cogently written work. Sensitive to the contradictions of U.S. history and how they are now playing themselves out in a changed world, this book will challenge and provoke in all the best senses of those words. Genuinely important to read and to think about."</p> <p> &#x2014;Richard D. Wolff, Emeritus Professor of Economics,University of Massachusetts Amherst</p><p>During the final century of the Roman Empire, it was common for emperors to deny that their civilization was in decline. Only with the perspective of history can we see that the emperors were wrong, that the empire was failing, and that the Roman people were unwilling or unable to change their way of life before it was too late. The same, says Morris Berman, is true of twenty-first century America. The nation and its empire are in decline and nothing can be done to reverse their course. How did this come to be?</p> <p>In Why America Failed, Berman examines the development of American culture from the earliest colonies to the present, shows that the seeds of the nation's "hustler" culture were sown from the very beginning, and reveals how the very tools that enabled the country's expansion have become the instruments of its demise.</p> <p>At the center of Berman's argument is his assertion that hustling, materialism, and the pursuit of personal gain without regard for its effects on others have been powerful forces in American culture since the Pilgrims landed. He shows that even before the American Revolution, naked self-interest had replaced the common good as the primary social value in the colonies and that the creative power and destructive force of this idea gained irresistible momentum in the decades following the ratification of the Constitution. As invention proliferated and industry expanded, railroads, steamships, and telegraph wires quickened the frenetic pace of progress&#x2014;or, as Berman calls it, the illusion of progress. An explosion of manufacturing whetted the nation's ravenous appetite for goods of all kinds and gave the hustling life its purpose&#x2014;to acquire as many objects as possible prior to death</p> <p>The reign of Wall Street and the 2008 financial meltdown are certainly the most visible examples today of the negative consequences of the pursuit of affluence. Berman, however, sees the manipulations of Goldman Sachs and others not as some kind of aberration, but as the logical endpoint of the hustler culture. The fact that Goldman and its ilk continue to thrive in the wake of the disaster they wrought simply proves that it is already too late: America is incapable of changing direction.</p> <p>Many readers will take exception to much of Why America Failed&#x2014;beginning, perhaps, with its title. But many more will read this provocative and insightful book and join Berman in making a long, hard reassessment of the nation, its goals, and its future.</p></p><h2>Socialism: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>Today, most people think of socialism as an outdated ideology.

It is not just another book of methods and practices.<br>Yoga originated in archaic magical means intended to overcome human anguish and suffering, These methods were known long before Patanjali, but Eliade has chosen to focus on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, who was the first to write down and codify "classic yoga." Following in Patanjali's path, Indian thinkers have been quick to distinguish true yoga from trances, self-hypnosis and false ecstasies. The many forms and aspects of yogic practice constitute a major part of India's history.<br>From earliest times, India has concerned itself with what we in the modern West call altered states of consciousness. Yoga allows a release from deterministic conditioning and permits the yogi to release himself into the true, indescribable freedom of liberation. With that release comes the appearance of extraordinary powers baffling to modern scientists and easily confused with "magical" or "occult" powers. Here is a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of yogic thought and practice.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Careful Writer</h2><p><b>The definitive writers&#x2019; handbook of alphabetized entries that provides answers to questions of use, meaning, grammar, punctuation, precision, logical structure, and color.</b><br><br><i>The Careful Writer</i> is a concise yet thorough handbook, covering in more than 2,000 alphabetized entries the problems that give (or should give) writers pause before they set words to paper.

Victorious in the Battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), and countless other campaigns, Marlborough, whose political intrigues were almost as legendary as his military skill, never fought a battle he didn't win. Although he helped James II crush the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth, Marlborough later supported William of Orange against James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and brilliantly managed England's diplomatic triumphs during the War of the Spanish Succession. Marlborough also bequeathed the world another great British military strategist and diplomat&#x2014;his descendant, Winston S.

A text-driven sermon allows the structure of the text to become buoyant, to come to the surface so that the sermon can be built around that structure. In this way the word of God (the meaning of the text) is presented in a way that is influenced by the voice of God (the genre of the text).<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Recapturing the Voice of God</i>, veteran preacher Steven W. Smith teaches how to preach genre-sensitive, text-driven sermons&#x2014;to allow the structure of the text to be the structure of the sermon. To do so, one must understand the genre of the literature in which God has chosen to reveal Himself. After a brief defense of genre-sensitive preaching, Smith categorizes Scripture genres according to their structure: story, poem, or letter. From these macro-level genres, each individual genre is explored for its unique features (law, prophecy, epistles, etc.). Smith then offers practical help in structuring a text-driven sermon and includes sample sermons as illustrations.</p><p><b>Steven W.

Schneider, himself an ordained priest, provides an insider&#x2019;s view of Whalen&#x2019;s struggles and breakthroughs in his thirty years as a Zen monk. When Whalen died in 2002 as the retired Abbot of the Hartford Street Zen Center, his own teacher referred to him as a patriarch of the Western lineage of Buddhism. <i>Crowded by Beauty</i> chronicles the course of Whalen&#x2019;s life, focusing on his unique, eccentric, humorous, and literary-religious practice.</p><p>&#x201c;More than a biography or a memoir ... a CELEBRATION of Zen Being.&#x201d;&#x2015;Michael McClure, author of <i>Of Indigo and Saffron</i><i>: New and Selected Poems</i><br><br> "Philip Whalen&#x2019;s poetry is complex, generous, and utterly amusing, as he was. David Schneider&#x2019;s biography uses Phil&#x2019;s own circular sense of time to fascinate us with this life of a poet and Buddhist; part beatnik, part 19th-century throwback, part profound animal&#x2015;-part roshi, still calling us to order and to rejoice."&#x2015;Alice Notley, author of <i>Negativity&#x2019;s Kiss</i><p> "Fellowship and remarkable clarity bring enlightened and generous understanding to this rendering of the life and times of singular poet and teacher Philip Whalen. His longtime friend in the Dharma, teacher and writer David Schneider transmits the delight and wisdom of this poet's bountiful spirit."&#x2015;Joanne Kyger, author of <i>Again</i>:<i> Poems 1989<i>&#x2013;</i>2000</i></p><p> "<i>Crowded by Beauty</i> is an exceedingly vivid and nuanced portrait of the inimitable Philip Whalen, a secret hero to many of us coming after.

In recent decades, new approaches (developmentally appropriate practice, Reggio Emilia, emergent curriculum, and anti-bias education) have had an enormous impact on the field. Change is in the wind for Jewish early childhood, too. At last, here is a guide to help integrate into the Jewish classroom the best that the secular field has to offer. It is indeed a challenge to make our early childhood classrooms Jewish every day, and not just on holidays and Shabbat. This outstanding and comprehensive book will enable every teacher to create a Jewish developmentally appropriate classroom, one in which Jewish values and themes permeate every learning experience every day. God, Torah, and Israel, the cornerstones of Judaism, are fully explored. Twelve holiday chapters provide substantial background information for the teacher, as well as concepts for each age level and engaging and unique activities. Further chapters discuss storytelling, music, secular holidays, working with interfaith families, keeping kosher at school, and even how to make the summertime Jewish. Bibliographies accompany each chapter, and there is a comprehensive resource list at the end of this volume which lists books for adults and for children, sources for supplies, pertinent organizations, and many Internet sites. Jewish Every Day is an invaluable contemporary resource for the twenty-first century &#x2013; a must for every early childhood teacher!</p><p>Maxine Segal Handelman, an expert in early childhood education, currently serves as the Director of Jewish Early Childhood Education for the Pritzker Center for Jewish Education of the Jewish Community Centers of Chicago (JCC).

Charged with embezzlement in 1894, he fled to Honduras, returning in 1897 to be with his ill and dying wife. His conviction was caused more by his eluding trial than by the conflicting evidence of theft. In the Ohio State Penitentiary (1898-1901), he began to write the stories that made him famous.

Some three years and 100,000 miles later he completed an often dismaying, disillusioning yet somehow proud "Imperial Progress." Here he describes with vivid recall, and with the aid of some esoteric history and lore, his sojourns on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia; on Tristan de Cunha and St. Helena in the South Atlantic, on Gibraltar, whose 30 miles of rock-hewn tunnels feature a Catholic Church, a pub and a fish-and-chips shop. Britain's "outposts" today suffer from considerable neglect, reports the author; Pitcairn in the Pacific is nearly depopulated, while the Caymans in the Caribbean serve as tax havens for rich Americans or stopovers for drug smugglers. Only Hong Kong remains an important remnant of the empire (until China claims it in 1997) and it is here that Winchester's descriptive powers are at their most satisfying. Photos. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.There is still a British Empire, and it is distributed in such a way that the sun shines on some portion of it at most, if not quite all, times. There is Hong Kong, of course, Bermuda, St. Helena, Ascension, Pitcairn, Gibraltar, and a host of other places, most of which are not easily reached. In the last few years Winchester has managed to visit all those colonies which are still governed by a resident British diplomat. He was in the Falklands at the time of the Ar gentine invasion (and spent three months in jail as a consequence). He also writes of the shameful removal of the Chagos Islanders to make way for the U.S. naval base on Diego Garcia. His skillful blend of political reporting, colonial history, and vivid travel writ ing makes for a fascinating book that should be a first choice for most librar ies. Harold M.

Georges Didi-Huberman&#x2019;s relentless consideration of these harrowing scenes demonstrates how Holocaust testimony can shift from texts and imaginations to irrefutable images that attempt to speak the unspeakable. Including a powerful response to those who have criticized his interest in these images as voyeuristic, Didi-Huberman&#x2019;s eloquent reflections constitute an invaluable contribution to debates over the representability of the Holocaust and the status of archival photographs in an image-saturated world.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Georges Didi-Huberman</b> is professor at l&#x2019;Ecole des hautes etudes en sciences sociales in Paris. He is the author of more than thirty books on the history and theory of images, including <i>Fra Angelico: Dissemblance and Figuration,</i> also published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>"<i>Images in Spite of All</i> provides the carefully extended anguished engagement, both epitaph and caption, that the subject demands."

In this collection of previously unpublished writings, Corbin examines the work of Carl Jung in relationship to the deep spiritual traditions of Eastern religion, the esoteric wisdom teachings of Sophia, the transformational symbolism of alchemy, and Sufi mysticism. <br><br>Looking at the many methods of inner exploration in the East, including the path of the Sufi and Taoist alchemy, Corbin reveals how the modern Western world does not have its own equivalent except in psychotherapy. Expanding Jung&#x2019;s findings in light of his own studies of Gnostic and esoteric Islamic traditions, he offers a unique insight into the spiritual values underlying Jung&#x2019;s psychoanalytic theories. Corbin analyzes Jung&#x2019;s works on Buddhism, providing his own understanding of the tradition and its relationship to Sufi mysticism, and explores the role of the Gnostic Sophia with respect to Jung&#x2019;s most controversial essay, &#x201c;Answer to Job.&#x201d; He also studies the rapport between the Gnostic wisdom of Sophia and Buddhist teachings as well as examining Sophia through the lens of Jewish mysticism. <br><br>Explaining how Islamic fundamentalists have turned their back on the mystic traditions of Sufism, Corbin reveals how totalitarianism of all kinds threatens the transformative power of the imagination and the transcendent reality of the individual soul. He shows how the underlying spiritual traditions of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity mesh with the spiritual teachings of Buddhism and reinforce the unity of the esoteric teachings of the world&#x2019;s great religions. Comparing the imaginal realm with Jung&#x2019;s archetypal field, he shows how we could transform the world by spiritualizing Jung&#x2019;s methods, enabling us to transcend duality and make the created world divine.</p><p>Henry Corbin (1903-1978) was one of the most important French philosophers and orientalists of the 20th century as well as one of the most influential scholars of Islamic mysticism. A former professor of Islam and Islamic Philosophy at the Sorbonne and the University of Tehran, Corbin was the author of several books, including <i>Alone with the Alone: Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn&#x2019;Arab</i>.I <br><br>Zen (on <i>The Book of Great Deliverance</i>) <br><br>An acquaintance with Zen Buddhism is accessible to Western readers in part thanks to the translations and admirable studies by Suzuki. We have all seen clearly that Zen is neither a psychology nor a philosophy in the sense that we usually give those words. The shock that Zen intends, operating within a soul--which then is transformed--comes to fruition in a totally irrational process, unconnected to the data and provisions of logic and dialectic. The implications of this process, and the discovery that on completion creates the initial reality of a new mode of being and perception are specifically what brings the Zen school of Buddhism and Jung&#x2019;s psychotherapy into harmonious relationship. We would like to take up this harmony here as the <i>initial theme</i> of our &#x201c;paraphrase.&#x201d; <br><br>From the outset, we might wonder if such a theme doesn&#x2019;t tend toward a contradictory initiative. What forms the essence and raison d&#x2019;�tre of Zen is the central intuition that is designated by the Japanese term satori, which we can attempt to translate by &#x201c;enlightenment.&#x201d; Here we have a<i> mysterium</i> <i>ineffabile</i>. Between the famous and very strange anecdotes with their often absurd wording that Zen offers for contemplation by its adepts, and the enlightenment that blossoms abruptly and brutally, there yawns an abyss that cannot be bridged with rational contemplation or explanation. As Jung says in his <i>Gesammelte</i> <i>Werke</i>, that all you can do is to maneuver through the neighboring proximity and the maneuvering is all the more difficult because you are then going counter to the spirit of Zen. The impression that seems to emerge is one of an experience a nihilo, that corresponds to an inner movement of what in astrology or cosmology is called <i>creatio</i> <i>ex</i> <i>nihilo</i>. What rejects this, setting itself in opposition to emanationism, is specifically the train of thought that begins by positing something based on which there would be derived or emanate, <i>necessarily</i>, all the superabundance of being. This being said, we do not mean to imply that the creationist doctrines were aware of this--far from it. But instead: the legendary brutality with which certain famous Zen masters replied to their students&#x2019; questions by hitting them with their stick or their fist, responds to the necessity to create pure, naked fact, before and beyond all affirmation and all negation, before and beyond all pre-existing material support on which it might repose. The explosion of an encounter, the injunction Show me--or discover--or study--your face as it was before you were born, before the creation of the world. Absolute <i>initium</i>. <i>Urerfahrung</i>. Experience that is <i>ab initio</i> and <i>ab imo</i>, initial and of the void. That which supports the intuitive understanding of what the void (<i>&#x15b;&#x16b;nya</i>) is&#x2014;this concept about which so many misunderstandings have arisen and which has led so superficially to talk of Buddhist &#x201c;nihilism.&#x201d; It is a question of expunging from consciousness all representations of objects, the assemblage or configuration of which are imposed on consciousness as data that it sustains, as well as expunging along with those representations all the laws of physics and history. One must put oneself back to the origin, pierce through to the mind whose own law alone assembled these objects and their representations. And then, finding this original Void, which is absolute power, the principle of contradiction will also have been surmounted, since things and beings once again will be there but in a transformed sense. <br><br>This is the sense of the very striking image used by one of the masters whom Suzuki quotes, &#x201c;Before someone studies Zen, for him, mountains are mountains and waters are waters. Once he has managed to penetrate into the truth of Zen through the teaching that a good master provides for him, then mountains are no longer mountains and waters are no longer waters. But when he has truly attained the place of rest (that is, obtained satori), then for him, once again, mountains are mountains and waters are waters.&#x201d; <br><br>The man who confronted the world of objects and the reality of objects was a man who was full of <i>himself</i>. What was this <i>himself</i> of which he was full and how, specifically, by giving way to illusion, does he &#x201c;egoify&#x201d; this &#x201c;I?&#x201d; How does he make it into ego by succumbing to the illusion of objects? An &#x201c;I&#x201d; that clearly has not been and could not have been set aside by a rational negation (that is, a negative, logical operation). <br><br>&#x201c;If I came to see you with nothing, what would you say?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Drop it!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;But I just told you I have nothing! How can I drop it?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;So, pick it up!&#x201d; <br><br>Because this nothing about which he has been thinking is still something affected by a negative sign, a nothing that is still rational, decreed by logic. It is not the Void that is referred to by the teaching of the Great Vehicle which is attained, &#x201c;realized&#x201d; through a shattering of the &#x201c;I&#x201d; that clamps onto rational consciousness--the consciousness that is like a blinding and a limitation of consciousness itself. The experience of satori is the emancipation from that, and, by discovering your face before the initial instant of the creation of things (where all things are created in front of you and through you the pure Thus), it gives you access to the Pure Land of transcendent consciousness. There we have a totality of the consciousness of life. &#x201c;The moon of the mind includes the whole universe: it is cosmic life and cosmic mind, and simultaneously individual life and individual mind.&#x201d;</p><h2>Surgical Care Made Incredibly Visual!

Many women realize they want more sexually but don&#x2019;t know how to get it. Based on her sought-after workshops for women, Amy Jo Goddard lays out her holistic, inside-out approach to sexual empowerment&#x2014;one that examines sexuality not only in terms of what happens in the bedroom but through a lens of personal power and the erotic energy that is at our core.

Many women realize they want more sexually and don't know how to get it. Based on her sought-after workshops for women, Amy Jo Goddard lays out her holistic, inside-out approach to sexual empowerment--one that examines sexuality not only in terms of what happens in the bedroom, but through a lens of personal power and the erotic energy that is at our core.&nbsp; Goddard shows us how to elevate our sexual intelligence and defines sexual empowerment in a fresh, accessible way that feels attainable for all.&nbsp;<br> <br> She guides us in mastering the nine elements of a sexually empowered life:<br><b>1.

The personality of Hitler himself, however, can scarcely explain this immense popularity or his political effectiveness in the 1930s and '40s. His hold over the German people lay rather in the hopes and perceptions of the millions who adored him.<br> Based largely on the reports of government officials, party agencies, and political opponents, Ian Kershaw's groundbreaking study charts the creation, growth, and decline of the "Hitler myth." He demonstrates how the manufactured F�hrer-cult served as a crucial integrating force within the Third Reich and a vital element in the attainment of Nazi political aims. Masters of the new techniques of propaganda, the Nazis used "image-building" to exploit the beliefs, phobias, and prejudices of the day. Kershaw greatly enhances our understanding of the German people's attitudes and behavior under Nazi rule and the psychology behind their adulation of Hitler.</p><p>Before writing the first volume of his substantial biography of Adolf Hitler, Ian Kershaw focused on the popular appeal of the Nazi dictator in <i>The "Hitler Myth"</i>. Arguing that "the sources of Hitler's appeal must be sought ... in those who adored him, rather than in the leader himself," Kershaw shows how Hitler's public image welded together antagonistic forces within the Nazi state, mobilized the nation for war, and contributed to the ethos that animated systematic and genocidal violence.<p> Responding to historians who maintain that Hitler's personality or ideological fixations accounted for his broad acceptance, Kershaw argues that, in the early 1930s, a sizable plurality of Germans hungered for an omnipotent <i>F�hrer</i> to stand above the political disharmonies of the Weimar state. Later, foreign policy and military victories attracted many more to the Hitler legend. However, victories were the price for popularity; and Hitler became more and more bloodthirsty as both his image and regime foundered under the blows of the Allied powers. The Hitler myth, then--a cultural phenomenon the Reich Minister Joseph Goebbels claimed as his greatest propaganda triumph--became a fundamental cause for the collapse of the Nazi State.</p><p> Kershaw's authoritative history of political culture in Hitler's Germany forcefully demonstrates that the <i>F�hrer</i>'s popularity rested less on "bizarre and arcane precepts of Nazi ideology than on social and political values ... recognizable in many societies other than the Third Reich." In our present political environment, which repeatedly features outcries for "leadership" from pundits and public servants alike, the disturbing lessons of <i>The "Hitler Myth"</i> are an urgent warning. <i>--James Highfill</i></p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Ian Kershaw</strong> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham and author of <em>Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich, Bavaria 1933-1945</em>.<br></p><h2>End of Capitalism (As We Knew it): A Feminist Critique of Political Economy</h2><p>Why does the future (not to mention the present) seem to offer no hope of escape from capitalism? Ironically, the author argues, it is not the economic discourse of the right but primarily the socialist and Marxist traditions that have constituted capitalism as large, powerful, active, expansive, penetrating, systematic, self-reproducing, dynamic, protean, victorious, and capable of conferring identity and meaning. <p>In this book J. K Gibson-Graham explores the possibility of more enlivening modes of economic thought and action, outside and beyond the theory and practice of capitalist reproduction. She draws critically on feminist and post structuralist theorizings, of subjectivity and the body, and on anti-essentialist aspects of Marxism. She seeks (and finds) protean forms of capitalist representation not only in economic policy and contemporary urban space but in the discursive practices of feminism, cultural studies and the politics of the left. Challenging the usual vision of capitalism as necessarily and naturally hegemonic, J. K. Gibson-Graham liberates a space of economic difference, one in which a noncapitalist politics of economic invasion might take root and flourish.</p></p><p>J. K. Gibson-Graham is the pen name of Katherine Gibson and Julie Graham, feminist economic geographers who work, respectively, at the Australian National University in Canberra and the University of Massachusetts Amherst."This is a truly remarkable book. I am quite confident that it will be at the center of debate for some time to come" <i>David F. Ruccio, University of Notre Dame</i> <p>"From the start, J. K. Gibson-Graham presents us with a text that is clear and accessible, but equally evocative of the complexities that the elected poststructural and overdeterminist approach requires ... In short, this book is an original, creative and elegant feast of theory and geographic opportunities. While the purpose and content is ambitious, Gibson-Graham provides an enticing way in which we might imagine and investigate economic heterogeneity. The influence of the book will likely be profound and widespread as geographers continue to explore these possibilities." <i>R. Liepins, University of Otago</i></p> <p><br> "This project of writing noncapitalism and not waiting for the revolution to do it remains an essential one." <i>Economic Geography</i></p></p><h2>Curse of the Spellmans: A Novel</h2><p>A follow-up to The Spellman Files finds Izzy struggling to retain her private investigator&#39;s license after a pseudo engagement and her fourth arrest, a challenge that is further complicated by David&#39;s marriage to Petra and Rae&#39;s teenage angst. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>Lisa Lutz, author of <i>The Spellman Files</i>, is back with another story of the shenanigans of the Spellman family: <i>The Curse of the Spellmans</i>. The "parental unit" started a private investigation business when Dad retired from police work. His wife assists him and their two daughters, Isabel, (Izzy) a 30-year-old with a habit of being arrested, and Rae, a 15-year-old Cheetos-loving teen, would like to think that they help out in the family business. Especially where Izzy is concerned, this is a stretch. Brother David is a successful attorney who has nothing to do with the family enterprise. He has troubles of his own. <p> Izzy has been living in the apartment of a friend while he is away. When he returns unexpectedly, it quickly becomes clear that being roommates with an old, cigar-smoking, poker-playing, big drinker isn't going to work. Izzy moves home temporarily and then the fun begins. She decides that their new next door neighbor, John Brown, whose landscape gardening business she judges to be a cover, is somehow making women disappear. She gets herself invited to dinner, discovers a locked room, believes his name is phony, follows him everywhere, has a restraining order against her, and <i>still</i> she can't let it go. </p><p> Meanwhile, Rae has befriended a great guy, a cop named Henry Stone, who is almost too good to be true. The reader starts pulling for him and Izzy to get together right away, even though he doesn't deserve the aggravation. Lutz keeps the ball rolling faster and faster with David's problems, her parents' frequent vacations, which they refer to as "disappearances," and the fact that everyone in the family has secrets from one another. If there is any curse at work here, it is that all the family members are terminally nosy. What they discover about each other and the other players keeps you turning pages and hoping that Lutz is hard at work on the next installment of this zany family's misadventures. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><b>Lisa Lutz</b> is the author of <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling, Edgar- and Macavity-nominated, and Alice Award-winning Spellman&nbsp;Series.

But recently, a new school of historians has challenged this view, creating what is known as the "new western history," an approach that gives a central role to the environment, native peoples, and the concentration of power in the hands of a few. Foremost among these historians is Donald Worster. In Worster's writings, the western past emerges not as a march of Manifest Destiny but rather as an unfolding relationship between humankind and nature.<br> In <em>Under Western Skies</em>, Worster provides an eloquent introduction to the changing traditions of western historical writing and then demonstrates his own approach through fascinating case studies. For example, he takes a hard look at the struggle by the Lakota to regain ownership of the Black Hills, examining not only the legal history of treaties and court cases but also the importance of the Black Hills in Indian religion and the way they have been mismanaged by the U.S. government. He discusses the cowboy in terms of the new ecology that arose from livestock ranching--the endless miles of fences, the changes in the environment wrought by extensive grazing, certain species of animals almost wiped out because they were considered a danger to sheep and cattle. But Worster's view of nature is not as simple or as, linear as for instance, Bill McKibben's stark picture in <em>The End</em> <em>of Nature</em>, a picture Worster argues against. From the mining ghost towns of the Rockies to the uprooted farm families of the Dust Bowl, nature sometimes wins the struggle. Even the Hoover Dam, he reminds us, may one day be overcome by the patient Colorado River.<br> <em>Under Western Skies</em> both offers intriguing insights into important aspects of our history and instills a new appreciation for the place of nature, native peoples, and the struggles over money and power in the western past.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Donald Worster</strong> is Hall Distinguished Professor of American History at the University of Kansas. He is the author of <em>Dust Bowl</em>, <em>Rivers of Empire</em>, and other works of history.<br><br>"A thoughtful, sensible collection...Worster reminds us that unlimited freedom and power are dangerous goals; both must be limited if the West's delicately balanced ecology is to endure."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Donald Worster is the dean of American environmental historians and one of our leading interpreters of the American West. He writes with the passion of a native son and offers perspectives that are as profound as they are provocative on the major environmental questions that have shaped the region's past and will define its future. <em>Under Western Skies</em> is a major contribution by a major scholar."--William Cronon, Yale University<p></p><br>"Donald Worster's honesty, critical intelligence, and talent for writing will prove to be three of the American West's most valuable resources in the late twentieth century. If Americans read this book and take it seriously, our prospects for living wisely and responsibly in this region will instantly brighten."--Patricia Nelson Limerick, author of <em>The Legacy of Conquest</em><p></p><br>"Donald Worster is a brilliant social historian. <em>Under Western Skies</em> is insightful, incisive, useful, and necessary. And a terrific read--vivid and compelling."--William Kittredge<p></p><br>"Worster writes clearly and with passion...He provides food for thought about the West's past and future."--<em>Gateway Heritage</em><p></p><br>"No one is a more powerful spokesman for the New Western History than Donald Worster, and no western historian is a better storyteller. He writes with passion and eloquence, with deep concern for the future of the region as well as its past. Readers will find these essays thoughtful, stimulating, and contentious."--<em>Great Plains Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"A probing set of essays of particular interest to graduate students because Worster poses research questions and describes patterns of previously published research. These essays never fail to meet Worster's previously established high standards for research and writing."--Barbara Handy-Marchello, University of North Dakota<p></p><br>"It's a case of man and mountain matching one another: Donald Worster is one of the finest American historians of his generation, and John Wesley Powell one of the most impressive Americans of his time. This book is very readable, very thorough, and very welcome."--Larry McMurtry, author of <em>Lonesome</em> <em>Dove, Crazy Horse</em> and <em>Roads</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Concept of Representation</h2><p>Being concerned with representation, this book is about an idea, a concept, a word. It is primarily a conceptual analysis, not a historical study of the way in which representative government has evolved, nor yet an empirical investigation of the behavior of contemporary representatives or the expectations voters have about them. Yet, although the book is about a word, it is not about mere words, not merely about words. For the social philosopher, for the social scientist, words are not &#34;mere&#34;; they are the tools of his trade and a vital part of his subject matter. Since human beings are not merely political animals but also language-using animals, their behavior is shaped by their ideas. What they do and how they do it depends upon how they see themselves and their world, and this in turn depends upon the concepts through which they see. Learning what &#34;representation&#34; means and learning how to represent are intimately connected. But even beyond this, the social theorist sees the world through a network of concepts. Our words define and delimit our world in important ways, and this is particularly true of the world of human and social things. For a zoologist may capture a rare specimen and simply observe it; but who can capture an instance of representation (or of power, or of interest)? Such things, too, can be observed, but the observation always presupposes at least a rudimentary conception of what representation (or power, or interest) is, what counts as representation, where it leaves off and some other phenomenon begins. Questions about what representation is, or is like, are not fully separable from the question of what &#34;representation&#34; means. This book approaches the former questions by way of the latter.</p><p>"A brillant study, characterized by a closely-knit organization of ideas and by a well-written text fairly bristling with challenging insights. It is the most comprehensive--and very likely the best--book yet written on the concept of representation."--<i>Polity</i>&nbsp;"A major contribution to the study of representative government. . . . It is the special virtue of her work that so well defined an argument has room for so many issues and so much scholarship."--<i>Political Science Quarterly</i>&nbsp;"An outstanding contribution to professional knowledge . . . great enough to be required reading."--<i>Journal of Politics</i>&nbsp;"We are very fortunate in having such a thorough and philosophically well-informed treatment of the subject. . . .From now on this book can be expected to be the starting point for philosophical discussions of its subject."&nbsp;--<i>Philosophical Quarterly</i>Hanna Fenichel Pitkin is a political theorist. She is a Professor Emerita of Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Reawakening: The Companion Volume to Survival in Auschwitz</h2><p>First published in English in 1965, &#34;The Reawakening&#34; is Primo Levi&#39;s bestselling sequel to his classic memoir of the Holocaust, &#34;Survival in Auschwitz.&#34; The inspiring story of Levi&#39;s liberation from the German death camp in January 1945 by the Red Army, it tells of his strange and eventful journey home to Italy by way of the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania. Levi&#39;s railway travels take him through bombed-out cities and transit camps, with keen insight he describes the former prisoners and Russian soldiers he encounters along the way. An extraordinary account of faith, hope, and undying courage, &#34;The Reawakening&#34; was praised by Irving Howe as &#34;a remarkable feat of literary craft.&#34;</p><p>Born to a Jewish family in Turin in 1919, Primo Levi was trained as a chemist. During World War II, he was arrested as a member of a partisan group and deported to Auschwitz. After the camp&#x2019;s liberation, he returned to Italy and worked as a chemist, writing only on the side. His first book <i>Survival at Auschwitz</i> was a personal account of his year at the camps. The follow-up memoir <i>The Reawakening</i> cemented Levi as a leading authority on the Holocaust. Other books by Levi include <i>Periodic Table</i>, <i>If Not Now, When?, The Monkey&#x2019;s Wrench, Other People&#x2019;s Trades, The Drowned and the Saved, </i>and more. Primo Levi died in 1987 after falling down his apartment&#x2019;s stairway. Biographers remain divided as to whether his fall was a suicide or an accident.Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Nonlinear Dynamics And Chaos: With Applications To Physics, Biology, Chemistry And Engineering (Studies in Nonlinearity)</h2><p>This textbook is aimed at newcomers to nonlinear dynamics and chaos, especially students taking a first course in the subject. The presentation stresses analytical methods, concrete examples and geometric intuition. The theory is developed systematically, starting with first-order differential equations and their bifurcations, followed by phase plane analysis, limit cycles and their bifurcations, and culminating with the Lorenz equations, chaos, iterated maps, period doubling, renormalization, fractals, and strange attractors.A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on applications. These include mechanical vibrations, lasers, biological rhythms, superconducting circuits, insect outbreaks, chemical oscillators, genetic control systems, chaotic waterwheels, and even a technique for using chaos to send secret messages. In each case, the scientific background is explained at an elementary level and closely integrated with the mathematical theory.Richly illustrated, and with many exercises and worked examples, this book is ideal for an introductory course at the junior/senior or first-year graduate level. It is also ideal for the scientist who has not had formal instruction in nonlinear dynamics, but who now desires to begin informal study.

It discusses the classical tradition as reflected in the architecture of Renaissance and Baroque Italy and the role given the human body in that tradition. It is recommended reading for all architecture students, and essential for those interested in the revival of classical architecture.</p><p>Henry Hope Reed is founder and president of Classical America and is the author of numerous books, including The Golden City and The New York Public Library. He lives in New York City.A new edition of this minor classic of architectural criticism is welcome not only because it is still worth reading but also because it is so apposite, for the architectural situation a hundred years ago was similar to our own. . . .In a period such as our own, where architecture is so dominated by conceptual interpretations, by a seemingly endless succession of -isms, it is useful to be reminded that buildings are&#x2014;or should be&#x2014; made to be experienced and enjoyed. &#x2014; Witold Rybczynski (The New York Review of Books)</p><h2>Masochism: A Jungian View</h2><p>Combining precise clinical descriptions with a wealth of cultural and mythic evidence, this book offers a radically new theory of masochism. Lyn Cowan, a practicing Jungian analyst, regards masochism as a manifestation of the &#34;religious instinct.&#34; In a clear and straightforward style, Cowan stresses the symptoms of masochism, which range from the kinkiest of sexual aberrations to the covert pleasure felt in the minor hurts and humiliations of ordinary life. The author reads these symptoms both as signs of an actual sickness and as stirrings of the collective psyche. Included is a thorough discussion of the clinical literature - Krafft-Ebing, Freud, etc. - as well as cultural case studies, the Flagellants of medieval times. Through Cowan&#39;s careful research, masochism emerges as a preparation for death, a strange necessity of the psyche that can lead the reader deeper into the pleasure and pain of his or her own wounds and vulnerabilities, there to discover the germ of genuine individuality.</p><p></p><h2>The Talmud, The Steinsaltz Edition: A Reference Guide (English and Hebrew Edition)</h2><p>Provides the essential guidelines for Talmud study.

In <em>Norse Atlantic Saga</em>, Gwyn Jones re-tells the dramatic story of the Viking voyages in vivid, striking prose and includes translations of six classic Viking epics: "The Book os the Icelanders," "The Book of the Settlements", "The Greenlander's Saga", "Eirik the Red's Saga", "Karlsefni's Voyage to Vinland", and "The Story of Einar Sokkason". Published to great acclaim in 1964, <em>The Norse Atlantic Saga</em> is now available in an expanded edition, which takes into account the tremendous gains that have been made in Viking scholarship in the past 22 years: the discrediting of the Vinland Map, greatly extended knowledge of the Vikings' life in Greenland and proof that Norsemen did indeed land and establish a settlement in L'Anse aux Meadows in the New World. For this expanded edition, Jones has largely rewritten his account of the Viking voyages, and added numerous new maps, plates, and illustrations, as well as appendices in which Robert McGhee, Thomas H. McGovern and Brigitta Linderoth Wallace, three prominent archaeologists, discuss their recent findings. The incorporation of this latest research into Gwyn Jones's narrative account of the Viking story guarantees its continued importance to Viking scholars as well as to readers interested in tales of bravery and heroic adventure.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Aircraft Design (Cambridge Aerospace Series, Series Number 11)</h2><p>Here is an accessible introduction to the fundamentals of civil and military aircraft design. Giving a largely descriptive overview of all aspects of the design process, this well-illustrated account provides an insight into the requirements of each specialist in an aircraft design team. After discussing the need for new designs, the text assesses the merits of different aircraft shapes from micro-lights and helicopters to super-jumbos and V/STOL aircraft. Subsequent chapters explore structures, airframe systems, avionics and weapons systems. Later chapters examine the costs involved in the acquisition and operation of new aircraft, aircraft reliability and maintainability, and a variety of unsuccessful projects to see what conclusions can be drawn. Three appendices and a bibliography give a wealth of useful information, much not published elsewhere, including simple aerodynamic formulae, aircraft, engine and equipment data and a detailed description of a parametric study of a 500-seat transport aircraft.</p><p>A well-illustrated and accessible introduction to the fundamentals of civil and military aircraft design.

In <i>The Revolution of Peter the Great</i>, James Cracraft offers a brilliant new interpretation of this pivotal era.</p><p>Linking together and transcending Peter's many reforms of state and society, Cracraft argues, was nothing less than a cultural revolution. New ways of dress, elite social behavior, navigation, architecture, and image-making emerged along with expansive vocabularies for labeling new objects and activities. Russians learned how to build and sail warships; train, supply, and command a modern army; operate a new-style bureaucracy; conduct diplomacy on a par with the other European states; apply modern science; and conceptualize the new governing system. Throughout, Peter remains the central figure, and Cracraft discusses the shaping events of the tsar's youth, his inner circle, the resistance his reforms engendered, and the founding of the city that would embody his vision--St. Petersburg, which celebrated its tercentenary in 2003.</p><p>By century's end, Russia was poised to play a critical role in the Napoleonic wars and boasted an elite culture about to burst into its golden age. In this eloquent book, Cracraft illuminates an astonishing transformation that had enormous consequences for both Russia and Europe, indeed the world.</p></p><p>James Cracraft is Professor of History at the University of Illinois, Chicago.Cracraft's interpretive history, grounded in his considerable expertise and reputation, is a welcome addition.

(Gilbert Taylor <i>Booklist</i> 2003-11-15)<br><br>This impressive little book [is] at once informative and intellectually interesting. (E. A. Cole <i>Choice</i> 2004-06-01)<br><br>This book represents a distillation of James Cracraft's magisterial work <i>The Petrine Revolution</i>, the three volumes of which cover Russian architecture, imagery and verbal culture. It is firmly rooted in a lifetime of research and a formidable body of sources, but targets the general reader in the form of an accessible, lightly-footnoted interpretative history of the reforms of Russia's most important ruler, who reigned from 1682 to 1725. (Lindsey Hughes <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2004-06-11)<br><br>Anglo-American historians have spent a great deal of effort on Peter and his reign in the last decades, the pioneer among them Cracraft himself. He has used his own work and that of his colleagues with thoroughness and tact to provide his own synthesis of the events and their meaning... Cracraft has succeeded in conveying the latest understanding of Peter's time, one that he himself has been so central in creating, in an elegant and highly readable form.

Erdrich later travels to Rainy Lake, to an island of real books, the world of an exuberant eccentric and close friend to the Ojibwe, who established an extraordinary library there a hundred years ago. Set against commentary about her own family and contemporary lifeand written in beautiful and powerful proseBooks &amp; Islands in Ojibwe Country is an intensely thoughtful, intimate, and fascinating cultural excursion.</p><p>Louise Erdrich puts the reader in the passenger&#x2019;s seat on a journey that is equal parts memoir, history, and mythology in <i>Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country</i>. She travels to Southern Ontario and Minnesota&#x2019;s Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake to learn about the land, her tribe, and the stories left behind. Whether by car, by boat, or on foot, Erdrich finds her highly personal expedition enveloped by stories found in books, songs and rock paintings of her Ojibwe ancestors, the islands, and even water: "You could think of the lakes as libraries," she notes.<p> </p><p> Erdrich expertly weaves the oral traditions of her ancestors into the account of her trip, integrating Ojibwe rituals and language. Her odyssey offers numerous history lessons unheard of in American textbooks. Erdrich, perhaps best known for her novel <i>Love Medicine</i>, once again reveals territory unfamiliar to--and untouched by--most of the outside world. One of Erdrich's last stops is on an island estate that belonged to explorer Ernest Oberholtzer, a friend of the Ojibwes. Ober&#x2019;s island, as Erdrich calls it, is home to more than 11,000 books. Erdrich delights in her surroundings, but admits she is in "somewhat uneasy agreement with the spirit of the island, which is to let the books exist as they were meant to exist, to be read, to be found and then unfound. To have their own life." It is a striking analogy to the American West and its Native people. Ultimately, Erdrich concludes that books should be preserved--and share! d. It is their presence that ensures she will find comfort and companionship. <i>--C.J.

It focuses not just on plotting techniques or prose style, but on the process of developing the habits and discipline of a writer, with beating writer&#39;s block, reading to improve one&#39;s writing, and other psychological techniques.</p><p>Even in 1934, Dorothea Brande knew that most writers didn&#39;t need another book on &#34;technique&#34; -- and this, before so many more would be published. No, she realized, as John Gardner notes in his foreword, &#34;the root problems of the writer are personality problems,&#34; and thus her wise book is designed to simply help you get over yourself and start writing, with techniques ranging from a simple declaration to write every day at a fixed time -- no matter what -- to exercises that come close to inventing the TM and self-actualization movements that would follow a few decades later.Born in Chicago, <b>Dorothea Brande</b> (1893&#x2013;1948) was a widely respected journalist, fiction writer, and writing instructor.

In <i>On the Postcolony</i> he profoundly renews our understanding of power and subjectivity in Africa. In a series of provocative essays, Mbembe contests diehard Africanist and nativist perspectives as well as some of the key assumptions of postcolonial theory. <br><br>This thought-provoking and groundbreaking collection of essays&#x2015;his first book to be published in English&#x2015;develops and extends debates first ignited by his well-known 1992 article "Provisional Notes on the Postcolony," in which he developed his notion of the "banality of power" in contemporary Africa. Mbembe reinterprets the meanings of death, utopia, and the divine libido as part of the new theoretical perspectives he offers on the constitution of power. He works with the complex registers of bodily subjectivity &#x2015; violence, wonder, and laughter &#x2015; to profoundly contest categories of oppression and resistance, autonomy and subjection, and state and civil society that marked the social theory of the late twentieth century. <br><br>This provocative book will surely attract attention with its signal contribution to the rich interdisciplinary arena of scholarship on colonial and postcolonial discourse, history, anthropology, philosophy, political science, psychoanalysis, and literary criticism.</p><p><b>Achille Mbembe</b> lives in Cape Town, South Africa.

The main part of the book describes ten of these icons', devoting one chapter to each, and shows what is wrong with them in the light of published scientific evidence. The chapters are all fairly brief, and each is divided into short sections, to make the material easier to assimilate.

More than two-thirds of its inhabitants are refugees, and more than half are under eighteen years of age. Since 2004, Israel has launched eight devastating &#x201c;operations&#x201d; against Gaza&#x2019;s largely defenseless population. Thousands have perished, and tens of thousands have been left homeless. In the meantime, Israel has subjected Gaza to a merciless illegal blockade.<br> &nbsp;<br> What has befallen Gaza is a man-made humanitarian disaster.<br> &nbsp;<br> Based on scores of human rights reports, Norman G.&nbsp;Finkelstein's new book&nbsp;presents a meticulously researched inquest into Gaza&#x2019;s martyrdom. He shows that although Israel has justified its assaults in the name of self-defense, in fact these actions constituted flagrant violations of international law.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Finkelstein also documents that the guardians of international law&#x2014;from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to the UN Human Rights Council&#x2014;ultimately failed Gaza. One of his most disturbing conclusions is that,&nbsp;after Judge&nbsp;Richard Goldstone's humiliating retraction of his UN report, human rights organizations succumbed to the Israeli juggernaut.<br><br> Finkelstein&#x2019;s magnum opus is both a monument to Gaza&#x2019;s martyrs and an act of resistance against the forgetfulness of history.</p><p>"This is the voice I listen for, when I want to learn the deepest reality about Jews, Zionists, Israelis, and Palestinians. Norman Finkelstein is surely one of the forty honest humans the Scripture alludes to who can save 'Sodom' (our Earth) by pointing out, again and again, the sometimes soul-shriveling but unavoidable Truth. There is no one like him today, but in my bones I know this incredible warrior for Humanity and Justice is an archetype that has always been. And will always be.

Although a non-lawyer, he masters the legal issues, the Geneva Conventions, ICJ advisory opinions, UN resolutions, and commission reports, weaving them into a compelling narrative, an articulate appeal for justice, a protest against the moral cop-out of the international community.

Destruction of businesses, fortunes, products, and careers is the price of progress toward a better material life. No one understood this bedrock economic principle better than Joseph A. Schumpeter. "Creative destruction," he said, is the driving force of capitalism. </p><p> Described by John Kenneth Galbraith as "the most sophisticated conservative" of the twentieth century, Schumpeter made his mark as the prophet of incessant change. His vision was stark: Nearly all businesses fail, victims of innovation by their competitors. Businesspeople ignore this lesson at their peril--to survive, they must be entrepreneurial and think strategically. Yet in Schumpeter's view, the general prosperity produced by the "capitalist engine" far outweighs the wreckage it leaves behind. </p><p> During a tumultuous life spanning two world wars, the Great Depression, and the early Cold War, Schumpeter reinvented himself many times. From boy wonder in turn-of-the-century Vienna to captivating Harvard professor, he was stalked by tragedy and haunted by the specter of his rival, John Maynard Keynes. By 1983--the centennial of the birth of both men--Forbes christened Schumpeter, not Keynes, the best navigator through the turbulent seas of globalization. Time has proved that assessment accurate. </p><p> <i>Prophet of Innovation</i> is also the private story of a man rescued repeatedly by women who loved him and put his well-being above their own. Without them, he would likely have perished, so fierce were the conflicts between his reason and his emotions. Drawing on all of Schumpeter's writings, including many intimate diaries and letters never before used, this biography paints the full portrait of a magnetic figure who aspired to become the world's greatest economist, lover, and horseman--and admitted to failure only with the horses. </p></p><p>Thomas K. McCraw is Straus Professor of Business History Emeritus at the Harvard Business School. His book <i>Prophets of Regulation</i> was awarded the 1985 Pulitzer Prize in history.This well-paced and beautifully written book explains not only Schumpeter's work but also the fast-changing phenomenon of modern capitalism. McCraw brings out Schumpeter's energy and charisma as well as the power of his ideas, quite skillfully linking the economist's colorful and adventurous personal life with the development of his views. This book is a fine tribute to a great thinker. <br> --Harold James, Princeton University<br><br>A welcome book--a truly penetrating biography of the most influential theorist of finance capitalism.<br> --Edmund S. Phelps, 2006 Nobel Laureate in Economics<br><br>A most compelling portrait of a complex man who has had a profound influence on how we think about entrepreneurship.<br> --Amar Bhid�, Columbia University<br><br>[Schumpeter's] private life was no less fascinating than his public message. In <i>Prophet of Innovation</i>, Thomas McCraw--emeritus professor of history at the Harvard Business School--artfully weaves the two together.<br> --Dan Seligman (<i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2007-04-05)<br><br>In this biography, Pulitzer Prize winner McCraw neatly divides his emphasis between Schumpeter's professional and personal life. He portrays his subject as a somewhat self-absorbed insatiable scholar not entirely comfortable with his contemporaries, which might explain marriages and affairs with much older and younger women, as well as his affinity with students and often-strained relations with colleagues of his own generation. McGraw lucidly addresses Schumpeter's economic theories through an examination of his letters, lectures, addresses, articles, and major works...[An] insightful and highly readable biography.<br> --Lawrence R. Maxted (<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i> 2007-04-01)<br><br>[A] persuasive and eloquent biography.<br> --Jay Hancock (<i>Baltimore Sun</i> 2007-04-22)<br><br>Much honored as an economic prophet, Joseph Schumpeter has had to wait half a century after his death for this splendid full-dress biography covering his ideas, life, and times...[This is] a fat, learned biography by Thomas McCraw, one of America's most respected business historians, the author of a Pulitzer prize-winning history of the rise of regulation. He has found the perfect subject in Schumpeter. He succeeds in getting inside the economist's head, explaining not just what he thought but why he thought it. Beyond this, he also succeeds in painting a portrait of his times. <i>Fin de si�cle</i> Vienna, Weimar Germany, Harvard University before and after the first world war: all come to life on these pages. (<i>The Economist</i> 2007-04-28)<br><br><i>Prophet of Innovation: Joseph Schumpeter and Creative Destruction</i> is a well-written and entrancing look at one of the twentieth century's most important economic and political thinkers. McCraw's book may rightly take its place as one of the two or three best biographies of an economist ever written...[It] is so splendid because it succeeds on so many different levels. If the book were simply an account of the Harvard economics department, it would stand as a lasting and significant contribution to the history of economic thought. Alternatively, it is one of the best treatments of what it was like for European intellectuals to migrate to the United States. Or are you interested in why Austria fell apart during the 1920s, and how someone with as little real world experience as Schumpeter became Minister of Finance? The book is also a love story, and an account of how a possibly dysfunctional man can nonetheless find romantic happiness after repeated failures and tragedies. Last but not least it is an intellectual history...Every year there are three or four non-fiction books that have to be read, and this is one of them.<br> --Tyler Cowen (<i>American.com</i> 2007-05-04)<br><br>McCraw...frames his narrative confidently and writes beautifully...Best of all, McCraw is an extremely good interpreter of Schumpeter's published work.<br> --David Warsh (<i>economicprincipals.com</i> 2007-04-01)<br><br>An extraordinary new biography. <i>Prophet of Innovation</i> by Thomas K. McCraw chronicles the life of one of the 20th century's most original and insightful scholars...Like his contemporary and frequent rival John Maynard Keynes, Schumpeter makes for a rich biographical subject.

Why are birds so significant in our lives and our sense of the world? And what do our ways of thinking about and experiencing birds tell us about ourselves? <i>Birdscapes</i> is a unique meditation on the variety of human responses to birds, from antiquity to today, and from casual observers to the globe-trotting "twitchers" who sometimes risk life, limb, and marriages simply to add new species to their "life lists."</p><p> Drawing extensively on literature, history, philosophy, and science, Jeremy Mynott puts his own experiences as a birdwatcher in a rich cultural context. His sources range from the familiar--Thoreau, Keats, Darwin, and Audubon--to the unexpected--Benjamin Franklin, Giacomo Puccini, Oscar Wilde, and Monty Python. Just as unusual are the extensive illustrations, which explore our perceptions and representations of birds through images such as national emblems, women's hats, professional sports logos, and a Christmas biscuit tin, as well as classics of bird art. Each chapter takes up a new theme--from rarity, beauty, and sound to conservation, naming, and symbolism--and is set in a new place, as Mynott travels from his "home patch" in Suffolk, England, to his "away patch" in New York City's Central Park, as well as to Russia, Australia, and Greece.</p><p> Conversational, playful, and witty, <i>Birdscapes</i> gently leads us to reflect on large questions about our relation to birds and the natural world. It encourages birders to see their pursuits in a broader human context--and it shows nonbirders what they may be missing.</p></p><p><p>"An astonishing compendium brimming over with bird lore and theory, pertinent quotations and avian miscellany, all of it well-written and much of it amusing--a classic birder's bedside book if ever there was one."<b>--Peter Matthiessen, author of<i>The Snow Leopard</i> and <i>Shadow Country</i></b></p><p>"Reading Jeremy Mynott's <i>Birdscapes</i> is like having a leisurely conversation about a favorite subject with a close, widely read, and highly articulate friend.

This book is a sequel to Introduction to Topological Manifolds; Careful and illuminating explanations, excellent diagrams and exemplary motivation; Includes short preliminary sections before each section explaining what is ahead and why</p><p>From the reviews: "This book offers a concise, clear, and detailed introduction to analysis on manifolds and elementary differential geometry. ... Some of the prerequisites are reviewed in an appendix. For the ambitious reader, lots of exercises and problems are provided." (A. Cap, Monatshefte f�r Mathematik, Vol. 145 (4), 2005) "The title of this 600 pages book is self-explaining. And in fact the book could have been entitled &#x2018;A smooth introduction to manifolds&#x2019;. ... Also the notations are light and as smooth as possible, which is nice. ... The comprehensive theoretical matter is illustrated with many figures, examples, exercises and problems. Some of these exercises are quite deep ... ." (Pascal Lambrechts, Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society, Vol. 11 (3), 2004) "It introduces and uses all of the standard tools of smooth manifold theory and offers the proofs of all its fundamental theorems. ... This is a clearly and carefully written book in the author&#x2019;s usual elegant style. The exposition is crisp and contains a lot of pictures and intuitive explanations of how one should think geometrically about some abstract concepts. It could profitably be used by beginning graduate students who want to undertake a deeper study of specialized applications of smooth manifold theory." (Mircea Craioveanu, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1030, 2004) "This text provides an elementary introduction to smooth manifolds which can be understood by junior undergraduates. ... There are 157 illustrations, which bring much visualisation, and the volume contains many examples and easy exercises, as well as almost 300 &#x2018;problems&#x2019; that are more demanding. The subject index contains more than 2700 items! ... The pedagogic mastery, the long-life experience with teaching, and the deep attention to students&#x2019; demands make this book a real masterpiece that everyone should have in their library." (EMS Newsletter, June, 2003) "Prof. Lee has written the definitive modern introduction to manifolds. ... The material is very well motivated. He writes in a rigorous yet discursive style, full of examples, digressions, important results, and some applications. ... The exercises appearing in the text and at the end of the chapters are an excellent mix ... . it would make an ideal text for a comprehensive graduate-level course in modern differential geometry, as well as an excellent reference book for the working (applied) mathematician."

Koester offers a comprehensive look at a powerful and controversial early Christian text, the book of Revelation<i>.</i> Originally written for Christian communities in Asia Minor, Revelation depicts scenes of cosmic conflict in which God, the creator of the world, overcomes the forces of destruction and makes all things new.

Its evocative word pictures have inspired both hope and fear. Artists and musicians have woven its themes into their work. Few books have such a capacity to attract or repel. Interpretation is the art of asking good questions and working them through in dialogue with others. So when writing this commentary, I needed to listen carefully to the text of Revelation and to the many ways in which it has been read. My approach had to be interdisciplinary, because Revelation invites questions arising from studies in literature and history, rhetoric and sociology, theology and art. I want my own readers to share in the process of reflection and discovery, so they gain a deepened sense of the way the book challenges and encourages.Originally written for Christian communities in Asia Minor, Revelation depicts scenes of cosmic conflict in which God, the creator of the world, overcomes the forces of destruction and makes all things new.

Washington rallied 18 of the 135 slaves aboard a ship bound for New Orleans, the country's primary slave-trading market. The mutineers seized control, landing the ship in the British-controlled Bahamas, where their freedom was recognized.<br> Originally published nearly a decade before the Civil War, Douglass's novella was one of the earliest examples of African-American fiction. Douglass presents Madison Washington's heroism less as a matter of violent escape and more as a voluntary act of claiming self-ownership. Douglass's retelling encouraged readers to engage in the abolitionist cause. It captivated readers by equating black slaves'&nbsp;rebellion against tyranny with the spirit and democratic ideals of the American Revolution.</p><p>Former slave Frederick Douglass (1818&#x2013;95) was an author, abolitionist, political speaker, philosopher, and pivotal figure in the decades of struggle leading up to the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation.</p><h2>Etruscan Civilization: A Cultural History</h2><p>This comprehensive survey of Etruscan civilization, from its origin in the Villanovan Iron Age in the ninth century B.C. to its absorption by Rome in the first century B.C., combines well-known aspects of the Etruscan world with new discoveries and fresh insights into the role of women in Etruscan society. In addition, the Etruscans are contrasted to the Greeks, whom they often emulated, and to the Romans, who at once admired and disdained them. The result is a compelling and complete picture of a people and a culture.<br><br> This in-depth examination of Etruria examines how differing access to mineral wealth, trade routes, and agricultural land led to distinct regional variations.

Within a Christian world of church services and formal religious education, they have been warned repeatedly about the dangers (or sinfulness) of premarital sex. At the same time, popular culture has inundated them with a very different message: casual sex is fun, thrilling, expected, and no big deal. Jennifer Beste calls into question the widespread assumption that the media's narrative of sex is positively liberating, while a Christian theological account is repressive, sex-negative, and altogether irrelevant. Her argument is based on a qualitative analysis of college students' own accounts of their social and sexual culture. She draws on the reflections of 126 undergraduate students who set out as sober ethnographers to observe and analyze peers at college parties. Overwhelmingly, undergraduates' perspectives challenge a neutral or even benevolent view of hookup culture embraced by some sociologists, "sex-positive" feminists, and popular culture in general. Beste goes on to share her own and her students' theological and ethical reflections as they explored the intersection between their social reality, the Christian tradition, and other academic disciplines, and sought to discern more deeply: what it means to become fully human; what constitutes happiness and fulfillment; and how to envision and create more socially and sexually just communities.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jennifer Beste is Professor of Theology and holds the Koch Chair in Catholic Thought and Culture at the College of Saint Benedict in St. Joseph, MN. She is the author of </strong><strong><em>God and the Victim: Traumatic Intrusions on Grace and Freedo</em></strong><strong>m (Oxford University Press, 2007). Her research interests include</strong> <strong>trauma theory and Christian theology; ethnography and Christian ethics; sexual ethics; feminist ethics; and children, justice, and Catholicism.</strong><br><br>"<em>College Hookup Culture and Christian Ethics</em> weaves together original ethnographic research, theological reflection on full human living and loving, and a justice-oriented analysis of sexual norms and campus culture in a way that is engaging, insightful, and thought-provoking even if, at times, it is also unsettling and uncomfortable ... For anyone interested in learning more about student experiences and working toward creating more just and supportive environments for college students, <em>College Hookup Culture and Christian Ethics</em> is an engaging and worthwhile read." --Abbylynn Helgevold, <em>Reading Religion</em><p></p><br>"This book offers an astonishingly new and courageous perspective on questions of sexuality, especially in the context of contemporary student sexual practice in American colleges and universities. Without being 'moralistic,' Jennifer Beste intriguingly combines student empirical research with both secular and Christian anthropological, theological, and ethical proposals. In its fullness, this is a book that brilliantly probes both pain and pleasure, love and happiness, justice and care, hope and community-illuminated within the complex sphere of human sexuality."--Margaret A. Farley, Gilbert L. Stark Professor Emerita of Christian Ethics, Yale University Divinity School<p></p><br>"Few works in Christian sexual ethics draw upon ethnographic methodologies to take into account the perspectives of the moral agents themselves. Professor Beste's study does just that. The amount and richness of the gathered qualitative material alone makes this book well worth the read. But Professor Beste goes well beyond field description to trenchant analysis of the allure and dangers of hook-up culture for young adults. This book will be a benchmark in both ethnographic theology and qualitative sociology on the subject."--Todd Whitmore, Associate Professor, Department of Theology and Department of Anthropology, University of Notre Dame<p></p><br>"Beste writes: 'At root is the fundamental fear that vulnerability to being hurt and betrayed represents failure, which has become the greatest social taboo of all.' Risk taboo. Risk knowing the young people around you. Risk reading what you don't want to know. I am an ordained minister and a mother. I teach at a university notorious for hookup culture.

The decisions of a few industrial leaders shake the roots of capitalism and reawaken man's awareness of himself as a heroic being.</p><p>Born February 2, 1905, Ayn Rand published her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, in 1936. <i>Anthem</i> followed in 1938. It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Ms. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, The Virtue of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ayn Rand held that art is a &#x201c;re-creation of reality according to an artist&#x2019;s metaphysical value judgments.&#x201d; By its nature, therefore, a novel (like a statue or a symphony) does not require or tolerate an explanatory preface; it is a self-contained universe, aloof from commentary, beckoning the reader to enter, perceive, respond.</p><p>Ayn Rand would never have approved of a didactic (or laudatory) introduction to her book, and I have no intention of flouting her wishes. Instead, I am going to give her the floor. I am going to let you in on some of the thinking she did as she was preparing to write &nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged.</i></p><p>Before starting a novel, Ayn Rand wrote voluminously in her journals about its theme, plot, and characters. She wrote not for any audience, but strictly for herself&#x2014;that is, for the clarity of her own understanding. The journals dealing with&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged</i>&nbsp;are powerful examples of her mind in action, confident even when groping, purposeful even when stymied, luminously eloquent even though wholly unedited. These journals are also a fascinating record of the step-by-step birth of an immortal work of art.</p><p>In due course, all of Ayn Rand&#x2019;s writings will be published. For this 35th anniversary edition of&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>however, I have selected, as a kind of advance bonus for her fans, four typical journal entries. Let me warn new readers that the passages reveal the plot and will spoil the book for anyone who reads them before knowing the story.</p><p>As I recall, &#x201c;Atlas Shrugged&#x201d; did not become the novel&#x2019;s title until Miss Rand&#x2019;s husband made the suggestion in 1956. The working title throughout the writing was &#x201c;The Strike.&#x201d;</p><p>The earliest of Miss Rand&#x2019;s notes for &#x201c;The Strike&#x201d; are dated January 1, 1945, about a year after the publication of<i>The Fountainhead.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally enough, the subject on her mind was how to differentiate the present novel from its predecessor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Theme</i>. What happens to the world when the Prime Movers go on strike.</p><p>This means&#x2014;a picture of the world with its motor cut off. Show: what, how, why. The specific steps and incidents&#x2014;in terms of persons, their spirits, motives, psychology and actions&#x2014;and, &nbsp;secondarily, proceeding from persons, in terms of history, society and the world.</p><p>The theme requires: to show who are the prime movers and why, how they function. Who are their enemies and why, what are the motives behind the hatred for and the enslavement of the prime movers; the nature of the obstacles placed in their way, and the reasons for it.</p><p>This last paragraph is contained entirely in&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Roark and Toohey are the complete statement of it. Therefore, this is not the direct theme of&nbsp;<i>The Strike</i>&#x2014;but it is part of the theme and must be kept in mind, stated again (though briefly) to have the theme clear and complete.</p><p>First question to decide is on whom the emphasis must be placed&#x2014;on the prime movers, the parasites or the world. The answer is:&nbsp;<i>The world.</i>&nbsp;The story must be primarily a picture of the whole.</p><p>In this sense,&nbsp;<i>The Strike</i>&nbsp;is to be much more a &#x201c;social&#x201d; novel than&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead. The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;was about &#x201c;individualism and collectivism within man&#x2019;s soul&#x201d;; it showed the nature and function of the creator and the second-hander. The primary concern there was with Roark and Toohey&#x2014;showing &nbsp;<i>what they are</i>. The rest of the characters were variations of the theme of the relation of the ego to others&#x2014;mixtures of the two extremes, the two poles: Roark and Toohey. The primary concern of the story was the characters, the people as such&#x2014;their&nbsp;<i>natures</i>. Their relations to each other&#x2014;which is society, men in relation to men&#x2014;were secondary, an unavoidable, direct consequence of Roark set against Toohey. But it was not the theme.</p><p>Now, it is this&nbsp;<i>relation</i>&nbsp;that must be the theme. Therefore, the personal becomes secondary. That is, the personal is necessary only to the extent needed to make the relationships clear. In&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;I showed that Roark moves the world&#x2014;that the Keatings feed upon him and hate him for it, while the Tooheys are out consciously to destroy him. But the theme was Roark&#x2014;not Roark&#x2019;s relation to the world. Now it will be the relation.</p><p>In other words, I must show in what concrete, specific way the world is moved by the creators. Exactly&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;do the second-handers live on the creators. Both in&nbsp;<i>spiritual</i>&nbsp;matters&#x2014;and (most particularly) in concrete, physical events. (Concentrate on the concrete, physical events&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t forget to keep in mind at all times how the physical proceeds from the spiritual.) . . .</p><p>However, for the purpose of this story, I do not start by showing&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;the second-handers live on the prime movers in actual, everyday reality&#x2014;nor do I start by showing a normal world. (That comes in only in necessary retrospect, or flashback, or by implication in the events themselves.) I start with &nbsp;<i>the fantastic premise of the prime movers going on strike.</i>&nbsp;This is the actual heart and center of the novel. A distinction carefully &nbsp;to be observed here: I do not set out to glorify the prime mover (<i>that was The Fountainhead</i>). I set out to show how desperately the world needs prime movers, and how viciously it treats them. And I show it on a hypothetical case&#x2014;<i>what happens to the world without them.</i></p><p>In&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;I did not show how desperately the world needed Roark&#x2014;except by implication. I did show how viciously the world treated him, and why. I showed&nbsp;<i>mainly what he is.</i>&nbsp;It was Roark&#x2019;s story. This must be the world&#x2019;s story&#x2014;in relation to its prime movers. (Almost&#x2014;the story of a body in relation to its heart&#x2014;a body dying of anemia.)</p><p>I don&#x2019;t show directly what the prime movers do&#x2014;that&#x2019;s shown only by implication. I&nbsp;<i>show what happens when they don&#x2019;t do it.</i>&nbsp;(Through that, you see the picture of what they do, their place and their role.) (This is an important guide for the construction of the story.)</p><p>In order to work out the story, Ayn Rand had to understand fully why the prime movers&nbsp;<i>allowed</i>&nbsp;the second-handers to live on them&#x2014;why the creators had not gone on strike throughout history&#x2014;what errors even the best of them made that kept them in thrall to the worst. Part of the answer is dramatized in the character of Dagny Taggart, the railroad heiress who declares war on the strikers. Here is a note on her psychology, dated April 18, 1946:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her error&#x2014;and the cause of her refusal to join the strike&#x2014;is over-optimism and over-confidence (particularly this last). Over-optimism&#x2014;in that she thinks men are better than they are, she doesn&#x2019;t really understand them and is generous about it.</p><p>Over-confidence&#x2014;in that she thinks she can do more than an individual actually can. She thinks she can run a railroad (or the world) single-handed, she can make people do what she wants or needs, what is right, by the sheer force of her own talent; not by&nbsp;<i>forcing</i>&nbsp;them, of course, not by enslaving them and giving orders&#x2014;but by the sheer over-abundance of her own energy; she will show them how, she can teach them and persuade them, she is so able that they&#x2019;ll catch it from her. (This is still faith in their rationality, in the omnipotence of reason. The mistake? Reason is not automatic. Those who deny it cannot be conquered by it. Do not count on them. Leave them alone.)</p><p>On these two points, Dagny is committing an important (but excusable and understandable) error in thinking, the kind of error individualists and creators often make. It is an error proceeding from the best in their nature and from a proper principle, but this principle is misapplied. . . .</p><p>The error is this: it is proper for a creator to be optimistic, in the deepest, most basic sense, since the creator believes in a benevolent universe and functions on that premise. But it is an error to extend that optimism to other&nbsp;<i>specific</i>men. First, &nbsp;it&#x2019;s not necessary, the creator&#x2019;s life and the nature of the universe do not require it, his life does not depend on others. Second, man is a being with free will; therefore, each man is potentially good or evil, and it&#x2019;s up to him and only to him (through his reasoning mind) to decide which he wants to be. The decision will affect only him; it is not (and cannot and should not be) the primary concern of any other human being.</p><p>Therefore, while a creator does and must worship&nbsp;<i>Man</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(which means his own highest potentiality; which is his natural self-reverence), he must not make the mistake of thinking that this means the necessity to worship&nbsp;<i>Mankind</i>(as a collective). These are two entirely different conceptions, with entirely&#x2014;(immensely and diametrically opposed)&#x2014;different consequences.</p><p>Man, at his highest potentiality, is realized and fulfilled within each creator himself. . . .Whether the creator is alone, or finds only a handful of others like him, or is among the majority of mankind, is of no importance or consequence whatever; numbers have nothing to do with it. He alone or he and a few others like him&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;mankind, in the proper sense of being the proof of what man actually is, man at his best, the essential man, man at his highest possibility. (The&nbsp;<i>rational</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;being, who acts according to his nature.)</p><p>It should not matter to a creator whether anyone or a million or&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;the men around him fall short of the ideal of Man; let him live up to that ideal himself; this is all the &#x201c;optimism&#x201d; about Man that he needs. But this is a hard and subtle thing to realize&#x2014;and it would be natural for Dagny always to make the mistake of believing others are better than they really are (or will become better, or she will teach them to become better or, actually, she so desperately&nbsp;<i>wants</i>them to be better)&#x2014;and to be tied to the world by that hope.</p><p>It is proper for a creator to have an unlimited confidence in himself and his ability, to feel certain that he can get anything he wishes out of life, that he can accomplish anything he decides to accomplish, and that it&#x2019;s up to him to do it. (He feels it because he is a man of reason . . .) [But] here is what he must keep clearly in mind: it is true that a creator can accomplish anything he wishes&#x2014;if he functions according to the nature of man, the universe and his own proper morality, that is, if he does not place his wish primarily within others and does not attempt or desire anything that is of a collective nature, anything that concerns others&nbsp;<i>primarily</i>&nbsp;or requires primarily the exercise of the will of others. (This would be an &nbsp;<i>immoral</i>&nbsp;desire or attempt, contrary to his nature as a creator.) If he attempts that, he is out of a creator&#x2019;s province and in that of the collectivist and the second-hander.</p><p>Therefore, he must never feel confident that he can do anything whatever to, by or through others. (He can&#x2019;t&#x2014;and he shouldn&#x2019;t even wish to try it&#x2014;and the mere attempt is improper.) He must not think that he can . . . somehow transfer his energy and his intelligence to them and make them fit for &nbsp;his purposes in that way. He must face other men as they are, recognizing them as essentially independent entities, by nature, and beyond his&nbsp;<i>primary</i>&nbsp;influence; [he must] deal with them only on his own, independent terms, deal with such as he judges can fit his purpose or live up to his standards (by themselves and of their own will, independently of him) and expect nothing from the others. . . .</p><p>Now, in Dagny&#x2019;s case, her desperate desire is to run Taggart Transcontinental. She sees that there are no men suited to her purpose around her, no men of ability, independence and competence. She thinks she can run it with others, with the incompetent and the parasites, either by training them or merely by treating them as robots who will take her orders and function without personal initiative or responsibility;&nbsp;<i>with herself, in effect, being the spark of initiative, the bearer of responsibility for a whole collective.</i>&nbsp;This can&#x2019;t be done. This is her crucial error.</p><p>This is where she fails.</p><p>Ayn Rand&#x2019;s basic purpose as a novelist was to present not villains or even heroes with errors, but the ideal man&#x2014;the consistent, the fully integrated, the perfect. In&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>&nbsp;this is John Galt, the towering figure who moves the world and the novel, yet does not appear onstage until Part III. By his nature (and that of the story) Galt is necessarily central to the lives of all the characters. In one note, &#x201c;Galt&#x2019;s relation to the others,&#x201d; dated June 27, 1946, Miss Rand defines succinctly what Galt represents to each of them:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>For Dagny</i>&#x2014;the ideal. The answer to her two quests: the man of genius and the man she loves. The first quest is expressed in her search for the inventor of the engine. The second&#x2014;her growing conviction that she will never be in love . . .</p><p><i>For Rearden</i>&#x2014;the friend. The kind of understanding and appreciation he has always wanted and did not know he wanted (or he thought he had it&#x2014;he tried to find it in those around him, to get it from his wife, his mother, brother and sister).</p><p><i>For Francisco d&#x2019;Anconia</i>&#x2014;the aristocrat. The only man who represents a challenge and a stimulant&#x2014;almost the &#x201c;proper kind&#x201d; of audience, worthy of stunning for the sheer joy and color of life.</p><p><i>For Danneskj�ld</i>&#x2014;the anchor. The only man who represents land and roots to a restless, reckless wanderer, like the goal of a struggle, the port at the end of a fierce sea-voyage&#x2014;the only man he can respect.</p><p><i>For the Composer</i>&#x2014;the inspiration and the perfect audience.</p><p><i>For the Philosopher</i>&#x2014;the embodiment of his abstractions.</p><p><i>For Father Amadeus</i>&#x2014;the source of his conflict. The uneasy realization that Galt is the end&nbsp;<i>of</i>&nbsp;his endeavors, the man of virtue, the perfect man&#x2014;and that his means do not fit this end (and that he is destroying this, his ideal, for the sake of those who are evil).</p><p><i>To James Taggart</i>&#x2014;the eternal threat. The secret dread. The reproach. The guilt (his own guilt). He has no specific tie-in with Galt&#x2014;but he has that constant, causeless, unnamed, hysterical fear. And he recognizes it when he hears Galt&#x2019;s broadcast and when he sees Galt in person for the first time.</p><p><i>To the Professor</i>&#x2014;his conscience. The reproach and reminder. The ghost that haunts him through everything he does, without a moment&#x2019;s peace. The thing that says:&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;No&#x201d;</i>&nbsp;to his whole life.</p><p>Some notes on the above: Rearden&#x2019;s sister, Stacy, was a minor character later cut from the novel.</p><p>&#x201c;Francisco&#x201d; was spelled &#x201c;Francesco&#x201d; in these early years, while Danneskj�ld&#x2019;s first name at this point was Ivar, presumably after Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish &#x201c;match king,&#x201d; who was the real-life model of Bjorn Faulkner in&nbsp;<i>Night of January 16th.</i></p><p>Father Amadeus was Taggart&#x2019;s priest, to whom he confessed his sins. The priest was supposed to be a positive character, honestly devoted to the good but practicing consistently the morality of mercy. Miss Rand dropped him, she told me, when she found that it was impossible to make such a character convincing.</p><p>The Professor is Robert Stadler.</p></p><h2>John Frederick Kensett: An American Master</h2><p>Traces the life and career of the nineteenth-century American painter</p><p></p><h2>Writing for Litigation (Aspen Coursebooks)</h2><p><b>Writing for Litigation</b> offers in-depth coverage and helpful tips for every type of document associated with the life of a case, from the client engagement letter to motions, discovery, client communications, affidavits, and more.

In 1931 her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel Rebecca that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children. Many of du Maurier&#39;s bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds and Nicolas Roeg&#39;s Don&#39;t Look Now. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE.

Compulsive and impassioned, he abandons his home, wife, and children to devote himself slavishly to painting. In a tiny studio in Paris, he fills canvas after canvas, refusing to sell or even exhibit his work.

In much of its general outline, this famous novel follows the life of Paul Gauguin, famous French post-impressionist painter, but it is not a novelized biography of Gauguin. Rather it is a sharply delineated, carefully wrought "private life", written by one of the most vivid and penetrating contemporary literary masters.<p>Charles Strickland, the central character, was a stock broker in London. One day, at the age of forty, he left his business, his wife and their children and went to Paris. He had neither money nor prospects. He knew almost nothing of art. But he was seized with a passion to paint and for the rest of his life nothing else mattered to him. He gave up everything to which he had been accustomed for extreme poverty, social ostracism and the freedom to paint. When he finally died of leprosy in Tahiti, where he had gone native, the few paintings which turned up for sale brought only six to ten francs apiece. But he had achieved his desire to create beauty and with the years, the world fully recognized his blazing genius.</p></p><h2>Peace and Conflict Studies</h2><p><p>The thoroughly updated <strong>Fourth Edition</strong> of the gold standard text explores historical and current topics in today&#x2019;s rapidly changing world to provide a comprehensive introduction to peace and conflict studies.

But a New Yorker can fly to Los Angeles--or Borneo--with very little fear. Psychologists have done little to explain this: for years, they have held that our biology puts a hard upper limit--about 150 people--on the size of our social groups. But human societies are in fact vastly larger. How do we manage--by and large--to get along with each other?<br><br> In this paradigm-shattering book, biologist Mark W. Moffett draws on findings in psychology, sociology and anthropology to explain the social adaptations that bind societies. He explores how the tension between identity and anonymity defines how societies develop, function, and fail. Surpassing <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> and <i>Sapiens</i>, <i>The Human Swarm </i>reveals how mankind created sprawling civilizations of unrivaled complexity--and what it will take to sustain them.</p><p><b>Mark W.

Miss Hird&#39;s aims are threefold: to provide a compromise between the traditional grammar-readers and the new textbooks which are not designed for beginners outside Sweden; to supply grammatical information and exercises and reading texts together for ease of reference; and to stimulate the student&#39;s interest in Swedish life, institutions and culture. The grammar part of the book is in seventeen lessons, each comprising a text in Swedish which Miss Hird has specially composed to include useful vocabulary and graded grammatical points upon which exercises (including translation exercises) are set for practice. The central theme of the texts is Stockholm, and attractive drawings illustrate it. To help the student, there is a full vocabulary list covering all the lessons, a brief summary of Swedish grammar, a glossary of grammatical terms, a check list of irregular verbs and a comprehensive index of the grammatical points covered in the book. In the reader part of the book, the texts chosen range from a short play by Strindberg to a sketch by Stig Claesson, one of Sweden&#39;s most popular contemporary authors. Each text is preceded by a short biographical and literary introduction and is followed by questions designed to test the student&#39;s comprehension and to stimulate his appreciation.</p><p></p><h2>How Poems Get Made</h2><p><p><strong>A comprehensive guide to writing or reading poetry, by &#x201c;one of our most lucid and important critics&#x201d; (American Academy of Arts and Letters).</strong></p> Why does a great lyric poem ask to be reread, even after we know it by heart? In <em>How Poems Get Made</em>, acclaimed poet and critic James Longenbach answers this question by discussing a wide range of exemplary poems, from Shakespeare through Blake, Dickinson, and Moore, to a variety of poets making poems today. In each chapter of <em>How Poems Get Made</em>, Longenbach examines a specific aspect of the poetic medium&#x2015;including Diction, Syntax, Rhythm, Echo, Figure, and Tone&#x2015;and shows how a poet may manipulate these most basic elements to bring a poem to life.</p><p>James Longenbach is the author of four previous volumes of poetry and six volumes of literary criticism, and his work is often featured in The New Yorker and the Paris Review. He teaches at the University of Rochester and lives in New York.&#x201c;[Longenbach] proceeds like a good teacher through many of poetry's essential modes... With healthy quotes from poems that demonstrate the technical and metaphorical values he lauds, Longenbach creates a book that is not literary analysis, but an explanation of how poems&nbsp;<em>work</em>&#x2015;which might just be enough to get people writing verse.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Millions</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[An] admirable, accessible blend of criticism and how-to instruction...

The Utes didn&#x2019;t seek a fight with the whites, most of whom they viewed as friends. However, powerful whites in Colorado wanted the Utes expelled. The Meeker affair was an opportunity to achieve that.<br><br>In <i>Troubled Trails</i>, Robert Silbernagel casts new light on the story of the Meeker Affair. Using details from historical interview transcripts and newspaper articles, he reveals the personalities of the major characters&#x2014;both Indian and non-Indian. He tells the story from many perspectives, including that of Indian Agent Nathan Meeker; the U.S. military; Nicaagat, a leader of the White River Utes; and Josephine Meeker, Nathan Meeker&#x2019;s daughter, who was held hostage by the Utes. Silbernagel took great pains to tell a complete story, even following on horseback the trail taken by the Utes. As a result, his book paints a multifaceted picture of what took place and, most importantly, his portrayal brings the Ute side of the story into focus.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>A fresh study of the Meeker Affair from the points of view of both the Utes and the non-Indian participants</p><p>Robert Silbernagel has been writing for Colorado news�papers since 1975.

In punishment, Zeus chained him to a rock, where an eagle clawed unceasingly at his liver, until Herakles freed him. For the Greeks, the myth of Prometheus&#39;s release reflected a primordial law of existence and the fate of humankind. Carl Ker�nyi examines the story of Prometheus and the very process of mythmaking as a reflection of the archetypal function and seeks to discover how this primitive tale was invested with a universal fatality, first in the Greek imagination, and then in the Western tradition of Romantic poetry. Ker�nyi traces the evolving myth from Hesiod and Aeschylus, and in its epic treatment by Goethe and Shelley; he moves on to consider the myth from the perspective of Jungian psychology, as the archetype of human daring signifying the transformation of suffering into the mystery of the sacrifice.</p><p><b>Carl Ker�nyi</b> was a professor of classics and the history of religion in his native Hungary. His works include <i>Eleusis: Archetypal Image of Mother and Daughter</i> and<i> Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life</i>, and he collaborated with C. G.

This unique text differs from most intermediate probability texts in that it focuses the theory directly on applications in the general field of financial risk management, including insurance, economics and finance. It will be appropriate for a first course in probability for students who have previously had two semesters of calculus. Past actuarial exam questions are included at the end of each chapter. This book will serve as an excellent background text for the more advanced probability material included on the Exams MLC and C of the SOA, Exams 3L and 4 of the CAS and the EA-1 Exam of the Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries. It was designed for several audiences, including students of actuarial science, mathematical economics, finance and risk management. It will provide an interesting and appropriate preparation for mathematically gifted students in finance and economics. It is not abstract or proof-oriented. Rather, it shows the student how to use probability theory to solve real-world problems.</p><p></p><h2>Classic Readings in Organizational Behavior</h2><p>CLASSIC READINGS IN ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR is organized around the field&#39;s most discussed themes: leadership, motivation, teams and groups, effects of the work environment, power and influence, and organizational change.

In an autobiographical letter, published in 1924, the author refers to this work as the "...bitterest of all, profoundly humoristic, about the decomposition of life....&#x201d;&nbsp; Vitangelo, the protagonist, discovers by way of a completely irrelevant question that his wife poses to him that everyone he knows, and everyone he has ever met, has constructed a Vitangel<em>o persona</em> in their own imagination and that none of these personas corresponds to the image of Vitangelo that he himself has constructed and believes himself to be. &nbsp;The reader is immediately immersed in a cruel game of confusing projections, mirroring the reality of social existence itself, which imperiously dictate their rules. &nbsp;As a result, the first, ironic "awareness" of Vitangelo consists in the knowledge of that which he definitely is not; the preliminary operation must therefore consist in the spiteful destruction of all of these fictitious masks.</p></p><p>Putnam was educated at the University of Chicago and the Sorbonne in Paris.</p><h2>Art Since 1900: Modernism, Antimodernism, Postmodernism</h2><p>Four key historians present a comprehensive history of art from the past century, documenting through 100 essays presented in a year-by-year format key events that contributed to the changing of artistic traditions and the invention of new practices and forms, in a volume complemented by more than 600 reproductions of some of the century&#39;s most important works.</p><p>Here's an exceptional rarity: a large, sweeping art history text book so well-done it almost makes the reader wish she or he were back in school. It's rather amazing that it took so long for a book like <i>Art Since 1900: Modernism, Antimodernism, and Postmodernism</i> to exist: a balanced, seven hundred page historical tome written with multiple perspectives in mind. As any undergrad knows, H.W. Janson's ubiquitous <i>History of Art</i> was written as if art history were some sort of race to colonize ideas and imagery; you'll likely not miss Janson's fetish for pointing out who did what first. Penned by a nimble crew who all teach at Ivy League universities, <i>Art Since 1900</i>, which mirrors the development of psychoanalysis and the creation of a huge international art scene, is on a smaller scale a history of contemporary theory and the art world almost as much as it is the art itself. Attention is paid throughout to important exhibits and texts, pointing out the rippling effect throughout the art community of these mirrors and portals. The book is arranged so that there are one or two essays per year. In such a novel format, often undervalued movements are given as much respect as Cubism and Minimalism. There are entire chapters here on Fluxus, feminist art, the Assemblage movement, Lettrism, the Independent Group, Gutai, Kineticism, the Harlem Renaissance, Aktionism, earthworks, video art, and the aesthetics of ACT UP. As with any history, there are personalities whose works are emphasized over that of others; the scant attention given to Jean-Michel Basquiat, for instance, is a rather large question mark. Quibbles aside, it's a very important, and nearly immaculate, work. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i> <p> <strong>Images from <i>Art Since 1900</i></strong> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td> </td> </tr><tr> <td></td> <td> </td> <td></td></tr> </tbody></table> <p></p>Benjamin H.

If children can open their minds to new ways of perceiving math, anything is possible! Greg Tang shows readers creative ways to use patterns and combinations of numbers to solve math puzzles quickly and effectively. Rather than laboriously counting 24 mushroom slices on a pizza, Tang suggests: "Let me give you some advice, / Just do half and count twice." And in adding the number of dots on a fan: "Instead of seeing groups of threes, / Count by fives and it's a breeze!"<p> Every two-page spread features cheerful computer-generated art by Harry Briggs, depicting rows of camels, beaches full of seashells, and vines laden with grapes. Tang's witty little accompanying verses tickle the fancy even as they challenge the mind. Guided by hints in the verses, readers find solutions to each math riddle, by looking "askew" to find a pattern, subtracting in order to add, or adding numbers that have easy sums before clustering them to add in groups. Solutions and explanations are provided in the back of the book. With a little creativity and common sense, as opposed to formulas and memorization, Tang believes that all kids can do well in math--and have fun while they're at it. Readers of <i>The Grapes of Math</i> are already ahead of the game. (Ages 6 to 10) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>This genuinely clever math book uses rhyming couplets and riddles, as well as visual cues to help the reader find new was to group numbers for quick counting. It's a return to number sets, with non of those boring parentheses and signs. Here the rhyme gives a clue to the new ways of grouping numbers. For example: "Mama mia, pizza pie, / How many mushrooms do you spy? / Please don't count them, ti's too slow, / This hot pie was made to go / Let me give you some advice, / Just do half and count it twice." A quick look at the pizza, and the reader can see each slice has the same number of mushrooms. count by threes for half the pie and double it. Each rhyme is given a double-page spread. The extra-large, brightly colored images leap off the page but never distract from the author's intent. Some riddles are very challenging, but the author provides all the solutions in the back. Once the reader has seen the answers, the strategy is obvious and can be applied to other situations. Great fun for math enthusiasts and creative thinkers, this might also teach adults some new tricks. A winning addition.---Kirkus Reviews, Dec. 1, 2000<br><br>Sixteen rhymed riddles invite readers to discover shortcuts to finding the number of items in double-spread scenes. In each case grouping is the key--finding a pattern among related items and occasionally adding to or subtracting from the total. There's some genuine higher-order mathematical thinking involved here, as children call upon intuition, observation, and strategizing as well as reliable old "math facts" to calculate rather than count. "Knowing Dice" shows six pairs of dice (two rows of double sixes, ones, and threes) and provides the hint, "Before you start please look around,/Adding's fast when tens are found." It suddenly becomes obvious that it will be quicker to group six/one/three four times than to point and count each dot. The "riddles" themselves never amount to more than rhymed instructions, and the workmanlike computer art, which does provide concise diagrams for counting, is flat and bland. Consistent repetition of the same math strategy works well here, though and with appended answers to boast, readers who start out slowly will have lots of opportunity to build aptitude and speed.---Bulletin of the Center for the Chidren's Books, March 2001<br><br>Picture puzzles accompanied by clues in verse encourage readers to embark on some inspired problem solving. Each riddle and an illustration are set on a two- page spread. The goofy rhymes set a humorous tone. Through patterns, grouping, and creative thinking, the problems to be solved will have children adding, subtracting, and multiplying. Throughout, Tang sneaks in useful visual strategies that can be used in solving other computation problems. Bright, appealing computer images add to the playful nature of the title. The solutions provided at the back of the volume include a miniature color reproduction of each picture and a clearly diagrammed answer along with text outlining the process employed to arrive at that answer. A fun addition to classroom and library shelves.---School Library Journal, March 2001<br><br>"Be careful! But don't just add what you first see. A better way there's sure to be." In this fun, creative book, the author has integrated bright, colorful, and eye-appealing computer-generated pictures with clever riddles in rhyme, plays on words, and math, to stretch and open the mind and develop problem-solving skills. Readers are encouraged to look beyond the obvious method of computation (merely counting the objects) and to try other, less obvious ways to find the answer to each riddle. Attractive, two-page spreads showcase each of the three to four double-line riddles, which organize subjects and objects such as ants, gopher holes, fishes, fruits, and foods into symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns and groups. Solving the riddle just may require a little creative thinkin</p><h2>The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth: A Struggle Between Two World-Systems (Center for Environmental Structure, 16)</h2><p>The purpose of all architecture, writes Christopher Alexander, is to encourage and support life-giving activity, dreams, and playfulness. But in recent decades, while our buildings are technically better--more sturdy, more waterproof, more energy efficient-- they have also became progressively more sterile, rarely providing the kind of environment in which people are emotionally nourished, genuinely happy, and deeply contented.<br> Using the example of his building of the Eishin Campus in Japan, Christopher Alexander and his collaborators reveal an ongoing dispute between two fundamentally different ways of shaping our world. One system places emphasis on subtleties, on finesse, on the structure of adaptation that makes each tiny part fit into the larger context. The other system is concerned with efficiency, with money, power and control, stressing the more gross aspects of size, speed, and profit. This second, "business-as-usual" system, Alexander argues, is <em>incapable</em> of creating the kind of environment that is able to genuinely support the emotional, whole-making side of human life. To confront this sterile system, the book presents a new architecture that we--both as a world-wide civilization, and as individual people and cultures--can create, using new processes that allow us to build places of human energy and beauty. The book outlines nine <em>ways of working</em>, each one fully dedicated to wholeness, and able to support day-to-day activities that will make planning, design and construction possible in an entirely new way, and in more humane ways. <br> An innovative thinker about building techniques and planning, Christopher Alexander has attracted a devoted following. Here he introduces a way of building that includes the best current practices, enriched by a range of new processes that support the houses, communities, and health of all who inhabit the Earth.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Alexander's</strong> series of groundbreaking books--including <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em> and <em>A Pattern Language</em>--have illuminated fundamental truths of traditional ways of building, revealing what gives life and beauty and true functionality to buildings and towns.<br><br><strong>HansJoachim Neis</strong> is a Professor of Architecture at the University of Oregon in Portland, and the Director of the Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory.<br><br><strong>Maggie Moore Alexander</strong> serves on the Center for Environmental Structure Board of Directors.<br><br>"Alexander, again, does what he does so well: in the process of adult argument, weave biology, theology, art appreciation, and geometry, plus cultural call outs from Jung to Fellini, into his tale." - <em>Architect's Newspaper</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Strategic Learning: How to Be Smarter Than Your Competition and Turn Key Insights into Competitive Advantage</h2><p><p>How to use Strategic Learning to rapidly respond to change and gain a sustainable advantage over your competitors</p> <p>What's even harder than creating a breakthrough strategy?

Drawing on an idea of Martin Luther King Jr.'s, Kohl argues for "creative maladjustment" in the classroom and anywhere else that students' intelligence, dignity, or integrity are compromised by a teacher, an institution, or a larger social mindset.<br> <br>This volume also includes "The Tattooed Man," Kohl's autobiographical essay about "hopemongering," which Kohl finds essential for all effective teaching in these difficult times.</p><p><b>Herbert Kohl</b> is one of the country's leading educators and the author of more than forty books, including the classic <i>36 Children</i>. Recipient of the National Book Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award, among others, he was founder and first director of the Teachers and Writers Collaborative and established the PEN West Center in San Francisco. Kohl lives in Point Arena, California.<b> <i>Preface</i> </b> <br> <br>Not-learning, hopemongering, and creative maladjustment are on my mind these days. Not-learning is the conscious decision no to learn something that you could learn.It consists, for example, of refusing to learn how to cheat on your axes cook crack cocaine, or yield to community pressure to become racist or sexist&#x2014;choosing not to learn something that you find morally offensive or personally noxious. Hopemongering is the affirmation of hope and the dream of a just and equitable future despite all the contrary evidence provided by experience. Creative maladjustment is the art of not becoming what other people want you to be and learning, in difficult times, to affirm yourself while at the same time remaining caring and compassionate.<br> <br>These three concepts presuppose a fundamental belief that we all have freedom of choice and free will, and that each of us is responsible for the kind of person he becomes and for the way he treats others. Not-learning, hopemongering, and creative maladjustment are the guiding principles of my teaching and my personal life&#x2014;principles sometimes difficult to maintain, but nevertheless persistent and insistent in their demands on everyday life.<br> <br>The essays in this book are reflections on the complexity of holding to one's dreams. <i>I Won't Learn from You</i> was written a few years ago, but I have been thinking about some of the stories and ideas in it for over twenty years. The ideas in it are rooted in my childhood and my teaching. There have been times when I've been unable to speak about what I've experienced, when events have overwhelmed my ability to understand or communicate them. The story of Akmir, which I've tried to tell in the title essay, has troubled me for years, and I probably would not have written it if other youngsters I know these days had not been living through the same pain Akmir experienced in his short life.<br> <br>"The Tattooed Man" was equally difficult for me to write because it had to do with why I became a public school teacher and why I continue to teach and care about public schools after seeing so many public schools that don't work. Writing it took me back to my childhood dreams and fantasies, and to my own experiences as a student in the New York City public schools. The essay is not just about schools. It is as much about how one comes back home to serve the community after having left how childhood shapes vocation, and how moral values become everyday principles. It is the most personal writing I have ever done.<br> <br>The essays on equity and political correctness are part of my ongoing attempt to clarify the way we talk about children and learning and oppose stigmatization of all kinds. They are attempts to engage people in the continuing struggle for social and economic justice and to place it in the context of teaching and learning.<br> <br>The final essay "Creative Maladjustment," is about the need to remain within public education while trying to transform it. It is an attempt to show, through stories, the ways i which positive changes can be made within systems that seem unmoveable and dysfunctional.<br> <br>All of these essays are extended stories, teaching and learning tales. They provide approximations o theories and expositions of ideas based on my experiences and those of people I've been privileged to work with or work for. Taken together they proclaim the abiding importance of teaching hope, resisting arbitrary authority, and taking control of one's own learning. They are my way of sharing the problems and rewards of trying to do decent work in a too-often indecent society and of affirming the importance of all our stories.</p><h2>A Seat at the Table: IT Leadership in the Age of Agility</h2><p><p>Agile, Lean, and DevOps approaches are radical game changers, providing a fundamentally different way to think about how IT fits into the enterprise, how IT leaders lead, and how IT can harness technology to accomplish the objectives of the enterprise. But honest and open conversations are not taking place between management and Agile delivery teams.<br><br> </p><p>In <em>A Seat at the Table,</em> CIO Mark Schwartz explores the role of IT leadership as it is now and opens the door to reveal IT leadership as it should be&#x2015;an integral part of the value creation engine. With an easy style, Schwartz reveals that the only way to become an Agile IT leader is to be courageous&#x2015;to throw off the attitude and assumptions that have kept CIOs from taking their rightful seat at the table. CIOs, step on up, your seat at the table is waiting for you.</p></p><p><p>Mark Schwartz is an iconoclastic CIO and a playful crafter of ideas, an inveterate purveyor of lucubratory prose. He has been an IT leader in organizations small and large, public, private, and nonprofit. As an Enterprise Strategist for Amazon Web Services, he uses his extensive CIO wisdom to advise the world's largest companies on the obvious: time to move to the cloud, guys. As the CIO of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, he provoked the federal government into adopting Agile and DevOps practices. He is pretty sure that when he was the CIO of Intrax Cultural Exchange he was the first person ever to use business intelligence and supply chain analytics to place au pairs with the right host families. Mark speaks frequently on innovation, change leadership, bureaucratic implications of DevOps, and using Agile practices in low-trust environments. With a BS in computer science from Yale, a master's in philosophy from Yale, and an MBA from Wharton, Mark is either an expert on the business value of IT or just confused and much poorer.<br><br> </p><p>Mark is the author of <em>The Art of Business Value</em>, which &#x2013; he is proud to report &#x2013; has been labeled by his detractors &#x201c;The Ecclesiastes of Product Management,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Apocryphal.&#x201d; The book takes readers on a journey through the meaning of bureaucracy, the nature of cultural change, and the return on investment of an MBA degree, on the way to solving the great mystery ... what exactly do we mean by business value and how should that affect the way we practice IT? He promises that <em>A Seat at the Table</em> is more canonical and less apocryphal.<br><br> </p><p>Mark is the winner of a Computerworld Premier 100 award, an Amazon Elite 100 award, a Federal Computer Week Fed 100 award, and a CIO Magazine CIO 100 award, which strongly suggests that there are less than 99 other authors you could better spend time reading.<br><br></p><p><br><br></p><p></p>Mark Schwartz is a rare combination: a deep thinker who has also applied lean, Agile, and DevOps principles at the highest level, leading an extraordinary Agile transformation in the US Federal Government at USCIS. In this book, he shows how modern IT lead-ers succeed by driving business outcomes rather than operating an order-taking function. This shift in organizational mindset is critical to any successful technology transformation but requires substantial changes in behavior at every level, and Mark's thorough analysis will prove invaluable to leaders who must execute it. (Jez Humble, CTO, DevOps Research &amp; Assessment LLC)<br><br>This book should be required reading for all technology and business leaders who are serious about digital transformation. It takes you on a provocative, fun, and comprehensive tour of the key areas that will promote and ignite agility, creativity, learning, community, and collaboration. This book may be about taking a seat, but this is no time to be sitting still! IT leaders will be convinced that their job is now about incentivizing and inspiring courage, passion, and technical excellence in service of business objectives rather than blindly servicing requirements. You will find practical advice on how to deal with projects, scope creep, IT assets, governance, security, risk management, quality, and shadow IT. (Jason Cox, Systems Engineering, The Walt Disney Company)<br><br>In his first book, The Art of Business Value, Mark brought together aunique understanding of modern techniques&#x2015;Agile, DevOps, andContinuous Delivery. In A Seat at the Table he grabs hold of theseconcepts and disrupts the conventional dynamics around the role ofthe CIO in any organization. His progressive thinking is unmatchedand a must read for leadership and practitioners of all kinds.

Mark shows thesteps needed to break free of these challenges and unlock potential,speed, and growth. His advice is pragmatic, practical, and to the point. (Barry O'Reilly, Founder of ExecCamp, Business Advisor, and Author of Unlearn and Lean Enterprise)<br><br>&#x201c;Agile&#x201d; is more than a new software development practice; it is a newway to think, engage, and lead. As Mark Schwartz points out in hiscompelling new book, A Seat at the Table, when CIOs re-conceptualizetheir role based on Agile principles, they will stop worrying about havinga seat at the table, and start realizing all of the full potential of IT. (Martha Heller, CEO of Heller Search Associates and author of Be the Business: CIOs in the New Era of IT)<br><br>I use to feel guilty when someone would ask me how do I get my leader-ship to understand DevOps if they refuse to accept it. My answer was, basically, you can't. Now I can give them a copy of A Seat at the Table. (John Willis)<br><br>If you're a CIO, read this book. If you're not a CIO but work closely with one, read this book. Mark Schwartz is the best of iconoclasts. He brings deep insights from his unique erudition and real-world experience&#x2015;ranging from a startup to government agency&#x2015;in untangling the dilemma of the CIO in the second decade of Agile. There aren't many people who can swing from Horace to Daniel Pink without losing a breath. And there aren't many who can critique Agile and Waterfall with equal insight. This is a surprising book&#x2015;well worth your (20%) time. (Sam Guckenheimer, Product Owner, Visual Studio Team Services, Microsoft)<br><br>Fresh thinking and useful advice fill the pages of Mark Schwartz's A Seat at the Table, which strikes an encouraging, instructive tone about the future of IT leadership and the CIO's expanding business role. &#x201c;If we cannot know the future, then we have to think a bit dif-ferently,&#x201d; he writes. And he does just that. Mark's argument that IT executives must change their behaviors&#x2015;dropping the &#x201c;command and control&#x201d; mindset in favor of community building and Agile leadership practices&#x2015;resonates throughout this well-organized, thoughtful book. While attaining that &#x201c;seat at the table&#x201d; often refers to CIO career goals, the ideas and approaches explored in this book are essential reading for anyone hoping to advance in the IT profession today.

Almost every page contains a situation I've seen in my day-to-day work, but that have not been articulated before. [A Seat at the Table is] required reading for anyone seeking to understand how IT should work with an organization to achieve success in an Agile age.

Like Einstein in science or Picasso in art, Toscanini (1867&#x2013;1957) transcended his own field, becoming a figure of such renown that it was often impossible not to see some mention of the maestro in the daily headlines.</p><p>Acclaimed music historian Harvey Sachs has long been fascinated with Toscanini&#x2019;s extraordinary story. Drawn not only to his illustrious sixty-eight-year career but also to his countless expressions of political courage in an age of tyrants, and to a private existence torn between love of family and erotic restlessness, Sachs produced a biography of Toscanini in 1978. Yet as archives continued to open and Sachs was able to interview an ever-expanding list of relatives and associates, he came to realize that this remarkable life demanded a completely new work, and the result is Toscanini&#x2015;an utterly absorbing story of a man who was incapable of separating his spectacular career from the call of his conscience.</p><p>Famed for his fierce dedication but also for his explosive temper, Toscanini conducted the world premieres of many Italian operas, including <em>Pagliacci</em>, <em>La Boheme</em>, and <em>Turandot</em>, as well as the Italian premieres of works by Wagner, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Debussy. In time, as Sachs chronicles, he would dominate not only La Scala in his native Italy but also the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He also collaborated with dozens of star singers, among them Enrico Caruso and Feodor Chaliapin, as well as the great sopranos Rosina Storchio, Geraldine Farrar, and Lotte Lehmann, with whom he had affairs.</p><p>While this consuming passion constantly blurred the distinction between professional and personal, it did forge within him a steadfast opposition to totalitarianism and a personal bravery that would make him a model for artists of conscience. As early as 1922, Toscanini refused to allow his La Scala orchestra to play the Fascist anthem, "Giovinezza," even when threatened by Mussolini&#x2019;s goons. And when tens of thousands of desperate Jewish refugees poured into Palestine in the late 1930s, he journeyed there at his own expense to establish an orchestra comprised of refugee musicians, and his travels were followed like that of a king.</p><p>Thanks to unprecedented access to family archives, <em>Toscanini</em> becomes not only the definitive biography of the conductor, but a work that soars in its exploration of musical genius and moral conscience, taking its place among the great musical biographies of our time.</p> 80 photographs</p><p>Harvey Sachs is the author or coauthor of ten books and has written for The New Yorker, the New York Times, and the Times Literary Supplement, among others. He lives in New York, and is on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.&#x201c;Extraordinary . . . . Indeed, I cannot think of another biography of a classical musician to which it can be compared: in its breadth, scope, and encyclopedic command of factual detail it reminds me of nothing so much as Robert A. Caro&#x2019;s <em>The Power Broker</em>. . . . Never before has [this] history been told so well.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tim Page, <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] monumental new Toscanini biography. The most riveting pages are devoted to the nineteen-thirties and forties, when the conductor converted his favorite repertory&#x2015;Beethoven, Verdi, and Wagner&#x2015;into emblems of the fight against Fascism. I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering: What would Toscanini have done if he had been confronted by geomusical snarl in Hamburg? He might have had something to say.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alex Ross, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Without doubt the most engaging, the best-written and certainly the most comprehensive Toscanini yet to be published.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rob Cowan, <em>Gramophone</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A very engaging and at times gripping chronicle of music and society, all of it devoted to the unending drive and conscientiousness that made Toscanini&#x2019;s performances so riveting&#x2015;and, to some, so repellent. . . . What comes through in Sachs&#x2019;s long chronicle is the extent of Toscanini&#x2019;s role, witting and unwitting, in transforming the way that classical music was produced and consumed in the twentieth century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Denby, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sachs&#x2019;s account is persuasive and compelling in the important ways. . . . . Today, Toscanini is receding from our consciousness, notwithstanding his many records. . . . Creative geniuses can survive for centuries, even millenniums; interpreters inevitably go over the cultural cliff. But that doesn&#x2019;t detract from the crucial&#x2015;the central&#x2015;role Toscanini played in our musical culture for well over 60 years. Nor from the almost universal regard he was held in as a man.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Gottlieb, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Toscanini&#x2019;s significance as a superb artist and a key figure in the international arena is brilliantly captured in Harvey Sachs&#x2019;s absorbing biography <em>Toscanini: Musician of Conscience</em>. . . . [Sachs] paints a captivating portrait of the conductor, from his birth in Parma in 1867 to his final days in New York 89 years later. . . . [A] feast for those drawn to music, culture, and politics.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jonathan Rosenberg, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As a study of the life and times of one of the greatest conductors of all time, this book will not soon be bettered.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Economist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What cannot be denied is the fact that this new biography constitutes a tremendous achievement for which both fans of the conductor and music lovers in general will be eternally grateful. . . Sach&#x2019;s new biography looks to be the most authoritative work on Toscanini that we are likely to see.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Hurwitz, <em>Classics Today</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;'Sachs&#x2019; own dedication to this force of nature has been fulfilled in a book which ranks among the best of 2017.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Philip Borg-Wheeler, <em>Classical Music</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;No other musician had as great an impact as Arturo Toscanini on the performance of opera and symphonic music in the twentieth century. With tremendous passion and stubbornness&#x2015;and thanks to his extraordinary talents&#x2015;he reshaped our ideas about what a conductor&#x2019;s goals should be and how to achieve them.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Levine</strong></p><h2>Remember Me to Harlem: The Letters of Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten, 1925-1964</h2><p>These engaging and wonderfully alive letters paint an intimate portrait of two of the most important and influential figures of the Harlem Renaissance. Carl Van Vechten--older, established, and white--was at first a mentor to the younger, gifted, and black Langston Hughes. But the relationship quickly grew into a great friendship--and for nearly four decades the two men wrote to each other expressively and constantly.<br><br>They discussed literature and publishing. They exchanged favorite blues lyrics ("So now I know what Bessie Smith really meant by 'Thirty days in jail / With ma back turned to de wall,'" Hughes wrote Van Vechten after a stay in a Cleveland jail on trumped-up charges). They traded stories about the hottest parties and the wildest speakeasies. They argued politics. They gossiped about the people they knew in common--James Baldwin, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, H. L. Mencken. They wrote from near (of racism in Scottsboro) and far (of dancing in Cuba and trekking across the Soviet Union), and always with playfulness and mutual affection.<br><br>Today Van Vechten is a controversial figure; some consider him exploitative, at best peripheral to the Harlem Renaissance--or, indeed, as the author of the novel<i> Nigger Heaven</i>, a blemish upon it, and upon Hughes by association. The letters tell a different, more subtle and complex story: Van Vechten did, in fact, help Hughes (and many other young black writers) to get published; Hughes in turn appreciated what Van Vechten was trying to do in <i>Nigger Heaven</i> and defended him, fiercely. For all their differences, Hughes and Van Vechten remained staunchly loyal to each other throughout their lives.<br><br>A correspondence of great cultural significance, judiciously gathered together here for the first time and annotated by the insightful young scholar Emily Bernard, <b>Remember Me to Harlem</b> shows us an unlikely friendship, one that is essential to our understanding of literature and race relations in twentieth-century America.</p><p>When their correspondence began in 1925, Carl Van Vechten (1880-1964) was the nation's leading Caucasian enthusiast for African American culture, and Langston Hughes (1902-67) was a struggling poet who lived with his mother in Washington, D.C., and plaintively closed one letter, "Remember me to Harlem." Over the four-decade-long friendship that's captured engagingly in these warm, funny letters, Hughes would become more famous, and Van Vechten less so, but their mutual affection and respect only would deepen. Editor Emily Bernard, a professor at Smith College, sensibly decided to include only a fraction of the letters that the pair exchanged, but to print those in their entirety, so that readers might get a vivid sense of each man's personality. Van Vechten is lighthearted, flirtatious, gossipy, effusive in his appreciation for Hughes' writing, and frank when he finds it not to his taste. Despite his unflinching commitment to civil rights, he's considerably less political than Hughes, whose equally witty correspondence has an underlying seriousness that's commensurate with a personal history that's far more turbulent and painful than that of his affluent friend. They share a dislike for "uplift-the-race" sanctimoniousness and a zest for African American folk culture; their letters are rife with references to the music of Bessie Smith and other great blues singers, as well as to the many Harlem Renaissance artists who were their personal acquaintances. The correspondence also provides a sustained chronicle of the working writer's life: they swap news of assignments and story ideas; Van Vechten generously makes his book-publishing and magazine contacts available to Hughes; and the poet loyally defends his friend's controversial novel, <i>Nigger Heaven</i>, against its numerous detractors. Helpfully, everyone is identified in Bernard's copious footnotes, which make this a handy reference work, as well as a delightful record of an extraordinary relationship between two uniquely gifted figures in American letters. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>"When the two first met in November 1924, Carl Van Vechten was a socially adept, married, homosexual, 44-year-old white man. Langston Hughes was a poor, single, sexually ambiguous, talented but barely published 22-year-old black man. Their shifting relationship over the next four decades is embodied in this correspondence. The adroit selection of photographs-many by Van Vechten-and Emily Bernard's lucid, scrupulous annotation bring this rich period to life."<br> -Steven Watson, author of The Harlem Renaissance and Prepare for Saints<br>"The friendship between Hughes and Van Vechten is surely one of the more inspiring in recent American history. Meeting in the 1920s as an aspiring young black poet and a celebrated white man of letters, they crossed almost every hurdle that an often disapproving society set before them. Sharp differences about art and politics, about money and the complexities of culture-these were never allowed to come decisively between them. They had in common an irrepressible love of life and art, an enduring sense of the value of friendship, and a delight in African American culture from top to bottom. These letters, superbly chosen, attest to the depth of their relationship, its sparkling optimism, its priceless sense of honor, and its determination to survive despite the expectations of a needlessly divided nation." <br>-Arnold Rampersad, author of The Life of Langston Hughes and co-editor of The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes<br>"Remember Me to Harlem is not only a major contribution to our understanding of the Harlem Renaissance, it is a delightful collection of gossipy correspondence between two of its leading-and most intriguing-characters."<br>-Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author of Wonders of the African World</p><h2>Ancient Peoples of the American Southwest (Ancient Peoples and Places (Thames and Hudson).)</h2><p>Combining the latest archaeological evidence with early first-person accounts, this simple, comprehensive, and informative text explains the rise and mysterious fall of Southwestern cultures in the United States.

It's masterfully written and will support you for a lifetime of peak thyroid health no matter where you currently are on your wellness journey. <br><br> This long-awaited volume is a book within a cookbook it contains a substantive educational component as well as over 100 original ''food as medicine'' recipes that not only satisfy and delight your taste buds, but also provide you with maximum nourishment for your thyroid and immune system and help you translate simple, thyroid- and immune-supportive nutrition to your plate. <br><br> For anyone who has wanted to cook confidently for optimal thyroid and immune function, this is your definitive guide. Be prepared for more unfussy, artfully crafted, mouthwatering recipes and well-studied, reliable, non-dogmatic thyroid- and immune-supportive nutrition information than you've ever seen in one cookbook. <br><br> Hashimoto's is the most common autoimmune disease and thyroid problems are among the most prevalent yet overlooked conditions that compromise women's wellbeing. (Additionally, men are being diagnosed in increasing numbers.) With their combined 20 years of nutrition and culinary wisdom, the authors have a mission to help those with Hashimoto's reclaim their health. <br><br> Markley is a dietitian with over a decade of nutrition and culinary experience and Grunewald is an integrative nutrition and hormone coach who's been in practice since 2008 successfully guiding her clients and students with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's to health and vitality. They've each experienced the challenges of Hashimoto's first-hand and have discovered that the most impactful way to reduce symptoms and improve thyroid and immune health for themselves as well as their clients is to focus on the sound nutrition strategies outlined in this cookbook. <br><br> They took a rigorous academic approach to this cookbook. In preparation for the choices of ingredients, Jill and Lisa created a ''nutritional springboard'' that's the foundation for their recipes. They extensively researched the most supportive nutrients for the thyroid and immune system and then identified foods that are <i>dense sources of these nutrients</i>, which ultimately laid the groundwork for <i>The Essential Thyroid Cookbook</i>. <br><br> Additionally, the recipes: <br><br> - Emphasize nutrient-dense, whole food ingredients full of color and flavor<br> - Are gluten-free, dairy-free, and free of refined sugars and other highly processed ingredients<br> - Are targeted to the home cook and easy to prepare; many can be made in 30 minutes or less<br> - Are thoughtfully created to appeal to all palates<br> - Contain sensible adaptations, whenever possible, to fit dietary practices commonly used to address thyroid imbalances and autoimmunity, such as Paleo and Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) <br><br> In this cookbook, you'll also discover well-researched and practical education about: <br><br> - Root causes of Hashimoto's and hypothyroidism<br> - Key nutrients known to boost thyroid and immune function and their food sources <br> - The connection between digestive health and thyroid imbalances<br> - Nutrition and lifestyle strategies for taming autoimmunity<br> - A discussion on ''goitrogenic'' foods, soy, and the dangers of ''low carb'' for those with hypothyroidism<br> - How to determine if certain foods may be triggering inflammation and autoimmunity <br> - Much, much more<br> This quintessential cookbook is a tour de force a work of art and a work of science. It belongs on the shelf in every kitchen of anyone diagnosed with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's.</p><p><b>Lisa Markley, MS, RDN</b> is a nutritional wellness expert with over a decade of experience working passionately towards improving the health of others.

She knew that taking thyroid drugs ''for life,'' with no consideration for why her thyroid was under-functioning or what to do about her immune dysregulation was not the answer, so she immersed herself in learning everything she could about autoimmunity and hypothyroidism and how to manage these conditions with whole foods, botanicals, lifestyle modifications, and other natural therapies. <br><br> Jill's Hashimoto's remains successfully managed without thyroid drugs.

The usual demand-side suspects include crony capitalists, consumer activists, economic elites, and labor unions. Less attention is given to government insiders on the supply side of politics - rulers, elected officials, bureaucrats, and public employees. In autocracies and democracies, government insiders have the motive, means, and opportunity to co-opt political power for their benefit and at the expense of national well-being. Many storied empires have succumbed to such inside jobs. Today, they imperil countries as different as China and the United States. Democracy - government by the people - does not ensure government for the people. Understanding how government insiders use their power to subvert the public interest - and how these negative consequences can be mitigated - is the topic of this book by Mark A. Zupan.</p><p>Much attention has been paid to the negative effects of government outsiders - such as special interest groups - influencing government agencies and officials. In this book, Mark A. Zupan addresses the equally important phenomenon of government insiders influencing the machinery of the state and putting their interests above the public interest.Mark A.

But when the hearth fires started burning in the Paleolithic, humankind broadened the exploitation of food and took one of several great leaps forward.</strong></p><p>All life on earth is dependent on energy from the sun, but one species has evolved to be especially efficient in tapping that supply. This is the story of the human species and its dedicated effort to sustain and elevate itself by making the earth&#x2019;s stores of energy its own. A story of slow evolutionary change and sharp revolutionary departures, it takes readers from the origins of the species to our current fork in the road.</p><p>&nbsp;With a winning blend of wit and insight, Alfred W. Crosby reveals the fundamental ways in which humans have transformed the world and themselves in their quest for energy. When they first started, humans found fuel much like other species in the simple harvesting of wild plants and animals. A major turn in the human career came with the domestication of fire, an unprecedented achievement unique to the species. The greatest advantage from this breakthrough came in its application to food. Cooking vastly increased the store of organic matter our ancestors could tap as food, and the range of places they could live. As they spread over the earth, humans became more complicated harvesters, negotiating alliances with several other species&#x2015;plant and animal&#x2015;leading to the birth of agriculture and civilizations. For millennia these civilizations tapped sun energy through the burning of recently living biomass&#x2015;wood, for instance. But humans again took a revolutionary turn in the last two centuries with the systematic burning of fossilized biomass. Fossil fuels have powered our industrial civilization and in turn multiplied our demand for sun energy. Here we are then, on the verge of exceeding what the available sources of sun energy can conventionally afford us, and suffering the ill effects of our seemingly insatiable energy appetite. A found of the field of global history, Crosby gives a book that glows with illuminating power.</p></p><p>Alfred W. Crosby is the author of the groundbreaking work The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492 and many other acclaimed works in global and environmental history. He is professor emeritus of history, geography, and American studies at the University of Texas in Austin. He and his family live in Nantucket, Massachusetts.Ever since cultivating fire, the human species has depended on tapping new sources of energy for survival, writes global historian Crosby (<i>Germs, Seeds, and Animals: Studies in Ecological History</i>). This enjoyable, humorously anecdotal study provides a succinct overview of our voracious "appetite for energy," most particularly the inventive (and indiscriminate) exploitation of sunshine in its fossilized forms&#x2014;peat, coal, oil and natural gas. The hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic era depended on muscle power to move through their world, and not much changed, Crosby notes, until the advent of the Industrial Revolution, when the first steam-powered engine was invented in 1712 by ironmonger Thomas Newcomen (James Watt, Crosby says, merely improved on Newcomen's design). Advances in harnessing energy trapped in organic matter followed quickly: whale oil used for lighting was supplanted by coal gas, kerosene distilled from petroleum and finally Thomas Edison's light bulb&#x2014;itself powered by the electricity generated from coal and oil. This history explores how an ingenious and adaptable humankind found ever more efficient ways to harness "concentrated sun energy." Crosby is optimistic about the Earth's future&#x2014;with the caveat that that future could be bleak without another energy breakthrough.

Her CD is <i>Mindful Meditations</i>, available on iTunes.Gr. 6-10. Switching between anecdotes of her own journey in Buddhism and advice on how teens can apply the Buddha's teachings to their lives, Winston offers a personal and thoughtful introduction to Buddhist thought and practice. The fundamental tenets of Buddhism are introduced through the lens of adolescence: finding karma at a high-school basketball game or promising that <i>metta</i> (loving-kindness) can free teens from anger toward siblings and parents (a miracle, indeed). Winston frequently quotes from teens she has met in her work at a Buddhist center in California, showing what they have learned from Buddhism on such subjects as skipping school. The writing doesn't rely on slang that will go out of style, but Winston's retellings of Buddhist sutras and stories are delightfully colloquial ("I want to understand life," the Buddha tells his father at one point. "I can't stay cooped up in this castle"), and her celebration of inquisitiveness and doubt will appeal to readers.

But in the early twentieth century, an exotic plague swept through the chestnut forests with the force of a wildfire. Within forty years, the blight had killed close to four billion trees and left the species teetering on the brink of extinction. It was one of the worst ecological blows to North America since the Ice Age&#x2015;and one most experts considered beyond repair. In <i>American Chestnut, </i>Susan Freinkel tells the dramatic story of the stubborn optimists who refused to let this cultural icon go. In a compelling weave of history, science, and personal observation, she relates their quest to save the tree through methods that ranged from classical plant breeding to cutting-edge gene technology. But the heart of her story is the cast of unconventional characters who have fought for the tree for a century, undeterred by setbacks or skeptics, and fueled by their dreams of restored forests and their powerful affinity for a fellow species.</p><p>"In prose as strong and quietly beautiful as the American chestnut itself, Susan Freinkel profiles the silent catastrophe of a near-extinction and the impassioned struggle to bring a species back from the brink. Freinkel is a rare hybrid: equally fluid and in command as a science writer and a chronicler of historical events, and graced with the poise and skill to seamlessly graft these talents together. A perfect book."&#x2015;Mary Roach, author of <i>Stiff</i> and <i>Spook</i><br><br>"A spellbinding, heart wrenching, and uplifting account of the American chestnut that asks the vastly important question: Have we learned enough, and do we care enough, to begin healing some of the wounds we've inflicted on the natural world?"&#x2015;Scott Weidensaul, author of <i>Return to Wild America</i> and <i>Mountains of the Heart</i><br><br>"This is a beautifully written account of the passing of one of the botanical wonders of the North American landscape, the American chestnut tree, which was nearly extirpated by a plague that entered the ecosystem and swept these great trees away. Freinkel, a gifted writer whose research is impeccable and whose reporting is topnotch, tells of the impassioned work of scientists over the past century and up to today, trying to bring the American chestnut back from the brink of extinction. Only a person in love with trees could have written this lovely book."&#x2015;Richard Preston, author of <i>The Hot Zone</i> and <i>The Wild Trees</i><br><br>"Graceful, provocative, and inspiring. Thoreau would be proud."&#x2015;Alan Burdick, author of <i>Out of Eden</i>, a 2005 National Book Award finalist<br><br>"In this beautifully written volume, Susan Freinkel ably describes the marriage of science and passion that is being brought to bear to save this majestic American tree from extinction. The people whose ancestors lived among chestnut trees and their places come alive for the reader, as does the appearance and spread of the blight and the heroes who are struggling with it today. The book concludes with a tantalizing vision of chestnuts in the forests again&#x2015;a thought of making the world right where it has gone wrong."&#x2015;Peter H.

The use of <i>The World: A Brief History</i> offers added flexibility in teaching World History, allowing instructors to supplement the text with additional readers or other material of their choice. And because the brief text was written by Fern�ndez-Armesto himself, it continues to offer the holistic, narrative approach to history that has made the comprehensive text successful at schools across the nation.</p><p>&#34;The World&#34; interweaves two stories-of our interactions with nature and with each other. The environment-centered story is about humans distancing themselves from the rest of nature and searching for a relationship that strikes a balance between constructive and destructive exploitation. The culture-centered story is of how human cultures have become mutually influential and yet mutually differentiating. Both stories have been going on for thousands of years. We do not know whether they will end in triumph or disaster. There is no prospect of covering all of world history in one book. Rather, the fabric of this book is woven from selected strands. Readers will see these at every turn, twisted together into yarn, stretched into stories. Human-focused historical ecology-the environmental theme-will drive readers back, again and again, to the same concepts: sustenance, shelter, disease, energy, technology, art. (The last is a vital category for historians, not only because it is part of our interface with the rest of the world, but also because it forms a record of how we see reality and of how the way we see it changes.) In the global story of human interactions-the cultural theme-we return constantly to the ways people make contact with each another: migration, trade, war, imperialism, pilgrimage, gift exchange, diplomacy, travel-and to their social frameworks: the economic and political arenas, the human groups and groupings, the states and civilizations, the sexes and generations, the classes and clusters of identity.<p>About Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p>Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto holds the Principe of Asturias chair of Spanish Civilization at Tufts University where he also directs the Pearson Prentice Hall Seminar Series in Global History.

Among other subjects, Prakash examines the term and structure of the office of the president, as well as the president&#x2019;s power as constitutional executor of the law, authority in foreign policy, role as commander in chief, level of control during emergencies, and relationship with the Congress, the courts, and the states.

Neck-deep in work that can be messy and confounding and na�ve in the ways of public communication, scientists are often unable to package their insights into the neat narratives that the public requires. Enter celebrities, advocates, lobbyists, and the funders behind them, who take advantage of scientists&#x2019; reluctance to provide easy answers, flooding the media with misleading or incorrect claims about health risks. Amid this onslaught of spurious information, Americans are more confused than ever about what&#x2019;s good for them and what isn&#x2019;t.<br><br>In <i>Bad Advice</i>, Paul A. Offit shares hard-earned wisdom on the dos and don&#x2019;ts of battling misinformation. For the past twenty years, Offit has been on the front lines in the fight for sound science and public heath. Stepping into the media spotlight as few scientists have done&#x2015;such as being one of the first to speak out against conspiracy theories linking vaccines to autism&#x2015;he found himself in the crosshairs of powerful groups intent on promoting pseudoscience. <i>Bad Advice</i> discusses science and its adversaries: not just the manias stoked by slick charlatans and their miracle cures but also corrosive, dangerous ideologies such as Holocaust and climate-change denial. Written with wit and passion, Offit&#x2019;s often humorous guide to taking on quack experts and self-appointed activists is a must-read for any American disturbed by the uptick in politicized attacks on science.</p><p>Paul A. Offit is the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children&#x2019;s Hospital of Philadelphia as well as the Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology and professor of pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He is an award-winning physician, coinventor of a rotavirus vaccine, and the author of several books on medical and scientific issues including, from Columbia University Press, <i>Autism&#x2019;s False Prophets</i>: <i>Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure</i> (2007) and <i>Vaccines and Your Child: </i><i>Separating Fact from Fiction </i><i></i>(2011, with Charlotte A. Moser).In breezy and deceptively conversational prose that often winks with humor, <i>Bad Advice</i> breaks down complex scientific subjects that have been distorted through several cultural lenses. Offit takes to task actors, network news anchors, quack scientists and even politicians who, unlike Jolie in her thoughtful article, have opined on scientific subjects in ways that misinform the public, on occasion to a potentially dangerous degree. (<i>Washington Post</i>)<br><br>Bad advice about your health, firmly grounded in fact-free marketing, greed, and science denialism, is omnipresent in the new and old media these days. One of the few reliable sources of good advice is Dr. Paul A. Offit who, unlike all too many scientists and doctors, is ready to take on the hype and lies of celebrities, charlatans, ideologues, and money-grubbers with logic, evidence, and humor. Take my advice: <i>Bad Advice</i> is just what you need to navigate the murky waters of an unending stream of really bad information about your health. (Arthur L. Caplan, Drs. William F. and Virginia Connolly Mitty Professor of Bioethics, New York University School of Medicine)<br><br><i>Bad Advice</i> gives us a front row seat to Offit&#x2019;s role on the leading edge of the vaccine fight as he shows just how important communicating good science can be. The author's rare storytelling blend of equal parts humorous anecdotes and serious facts leads to an entertaining and captivating read that is hard to put down. (Melissa Stockwell, MD, MPH, Columbia University Medical Center)<br><br>Paul Offit is a pediatrician, a vaccine scientist, and one of our foremost explainers of science. In <i>Bad Advice</i>, he distills what he has learned&#x2015;often the hard way&#x2015;from standing up for science in the face of bogus theories, quack remedies, and the flat-out denial of empirical fact. Skillfully, Offit uses stories of his many missteps in the treacherous public arena to teach us how to confront pseudoscience effectively. In the process, without noticing, we learn fascinating lessons in the relevant science. A forcefully-written, indispensable book, particularly at the present moment. (Geoffrey Kabat, cancer epidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and author of <i>Getting Risk Right: Understanding the Science of Elusive Health Risks</i>)<br><br>With humor and a unique perspective, Offit takes us step by step through our culture&#x2019;s missteps (and some of his own), relating stories of real science and the difficulties of communicating complicated concepts clearly to a skeptical and sometimes hostile public. <i>Bad Advice</i> shows us how we can succeed in the battle against pseudoscience, seductive gurus with simple messages, and snake oil-hawking celebrities. (Adam Ratner, M.D., New York University)<br><br>The beauty of mass communication in our free society is also our curse. Information flows so quickly, from so many different sources, that one can&#x2019;t help but be overwhelmed&#x2015;and too frequently misled. No one has fought harder over the years to educate the public, and to puncture the dangerously false dogmas of pseudoscience, than Paul Offit. <i>Bad Advice</i> is a brilliant extension of his dictate, so aptly stated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, that one is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts. Celebrities and politicians bear the brunt of Offit&#x2019;s elegantly written, often hilarious, pinpoint assaults. But what makes this book truly special is its vision of how science can, and must, be defended against its despoilers. <i>Bad Advice</i> is, in every sense, an essential read. (David Oshinsky, director of the Division of Medical Humanities at NYU School of Medicine)<br><br><i>Bad Advice</i> is a fun and educational book that will leave readers optimistic&#x2015;as Offit himself is&#x2015;that fact will ultimately prevail over fiction in the world of science and medicine. &#x201c;Although science is under siege,&#x201d; Offit writes toward the end of the book, &#x201c;science advocates are fighting back.&#x201d; (Arlene Weintraub, author of Heal: The Vital Role of Dogs in the Search for Cancer Cures <i>New York Journal of Book</i>)</p><h2>Theories of Object Relations: Bridges to Self Psychology</h2><p><i>Theories of Object Relations: Bridges to Self Psychology</i> discusses the work of the major American and British contributors to object relations theory, focusing on the ways in which these theories anticipated and enriched the emerging field of self psychology.

Just as other scriptural religions, Islam has produced a long tradition of interpretation for its holy book. Nevertheless, efforts to introduce the Qur&#39;an and its intellectual heritage to English-speaking audiences have been hampered by the lack of available resources. The Cambridge Companion to the Qur&#39;an seeks to remedy that situation. In a discerning summation of the field, Jane McAuliffe brings together an international team of scholars to explain its complexities. Comprising fourteen chapters, each devoted to a topic of central importance, the book is rich in historical, linguistic and literary detail, while also reflecting the influence of other disciplines.

Carefully removing his bandages, he realizes that he is the only person who can see: everyone else, doctors and patients alike, have been blinded by a meteor shower. Now, with civilization in chaos, the triffids - huge, venomous, large-rooted plants able to &#39;walk&#39;, feeding on human flesh - can have their day. The Day of the Triffids, published in 1951, expresses many of the political concerns of its time: the Cold War, the fear of biological experimentation and the man-made apocalypse. However, with its terrifyingly believable insights into the genetic modification of plants, the book is more relevant today than ever before. John Wyndham was born in 1903. After a wide experience of the English preparatory school he was at Bedales from 1918 to 1921. Careers which he tried included farming, law, commercial art, and advertising, and he first started writing short stories, intended for sale, in 1925. During the war he was in the Civil Service and afterwards in the Army. In 1946 he began writing his major science fiction novels including &#34;The Kraken Wakes&#34;, &#34;The Chrysalids&#34; and &#34;The Midwich Cuckoos&#34;.</p><p>THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS<br>A truly scary classic of a world at war with incomprehensible forces. A must read book and, a must see movie.<br><p>--Fred Dodnick, Vice President, Director of Trade Production</p>In 1951 John Wyndham published his novel "The Day of the Triffids to moderate acclaim. Fifty-two years later, this horrifying story is a science fiction classic, touted by "The Times (London) as having "all the reality of a vividly realized nightmare." <br>Bill Masen, bandages over his wounded eyes, misses the most spectacular meteorite shower England has ever seen. Removing his bandages the next morning, he finds masses of sightless people wandering the city. He soon meets Josella, another lucky person who has retained her sight, and together they leave the city, aware that the safe, familiar world they knew a mere twenty-four hours before is gone forever. <br>But to survive in this post-apocalyptic world, one must survive the Triffids, strange plants that years before began appearing all over the world. The Triffids can grow to over seven feet tall, pull their roots from the ground to walk, and kill a man with one quick lash of their poisonous stingers. With society in shambles, they are now poised to prey on humankind. Wyndham chillingly anticipates bio-warfare and mass destruction, fifty years before their realization, in this prescient account of Cold War paranoia.</p><h2>Harcourt Social Studies: Assessment Program, Grade 3</h2><p>Synopsis: Harcourt Social Studies is a comprehensive K-5 curriculum solution designed to engage and motivate every student.

As a means of spiritual reintegration and unification, ancient philosophy is inseparable from the hieratic rites. The theurgic &#x201c;animation&#x201d; of statues appears to be among the main keys for understanding how various royal and priestly practices, related to the daily ritual service and encounter with the divine presence in the temples, developed into the Neoplatonic mysticism of late antiquity.</p><p>"This remarkable book reintroduces us to a Platonism long forgotten in the West. In a passionate tour de force of scholarship and insight, Algis Uzdavinys argues that philosophy was once a mystagogic rite of initiation transmitted<i>&nbsp;</i>by the great Neoplatonic teachers from Plotinus to Damascius.&nbsp;Uzdavinys's wide scholarship not only draws profound connections between Platonic philosophy, theurgy, and the ancient Egyptian wisdom that Platonists acknowledged as their source, he also draws illuminating parallels between theurgy and Indian Tantra. His enraptured prose leads us into the non-dual vision of the later Platonists where each of us is invited to become a link in the Golden Chain that extends from heaven to earth." -- <b>Gregory Shaw</b>, Stonehill College, author of <i>Theurgy and the Soul</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "This book clearly establishes three things: that traditional myth (as the Neoplatonists maintained) is the symbolic expression of metaphysics, as metaphysics is the exegesis of myth; that Greek philosophy was not an isolated 'miracle' but a reinterpretation of perennial themes common to the ancient Near Eastern, Mesopotamian, Indian, and especially Egyptian religions; and that Platonic philosophical discourse was but one-half of a whole which included an invocatory/contemplative practice known as 'theurgy.'" <br> -- <b>Charles Upton</b>, author of <i>Knowings</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "In this most stimulating and wide-ranging work, Algis Uzdavinys, drawing on the resources of his enormous learning, leads Neoplatonic theurgy back to its roots in Ancient Egypt, thereby setting Platonic philosophy in a new and wider context. Students of Neoplatonism will find themselves much indebted to him, and all readers will find their outlook on life significantly changed."-- <b>John M. Dillon</b>, Trinity College, Dublin, author of <i>The Middle Platonists</i><br>Algis Uzdavinys was Head of the Department of Humanities at Vilnius Academy of Fine Arts, Kaunas Faculty, in his native Lithuania, before his death in 2010. His research included work on Hellenic philosophy, especially Platonism and Neoplatonism, as well as traditional mythology and metaphysics, Sufism, and traditional art.</p><h2>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers)</h2><p>Not only one of the last of over one hundred slave narratives published separately before the Civil War, <em>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</em> (1861) is also one of the few existing narratives written by a woman. It offers a unique perspective on the complex plight of the black woman as slave and as writer. In a story that merges the conventions of the slave narrative with the techniques of the sentimental novel, Harriet Jacobs describes her efforts to fight off the advances of her master, her eventual liaison with another white man (the father of two of her children), and her ultimately successful struggle for freedom. Jacobs' account of her experiences, and her search for her own voice, prefigure the literary and ideological concerns of generations of African-American women writers to come.<br></p><p>These two slave narratives expand our knowledge of the differing ways males and females coped with enslavement and later ordeals in flight. This popularly-priced anthology contains the often taught Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs and the recently discovered A True Tale of Slavery by John S. Jacobs, her younger brother, now reprinted for the first time.<br> <p><br> </p> <p>After Harriet&#x2019;s owner, a physician, repeatedly abused her, she escaped his sexual advances for a time by entering into a relationship with a local attorney. Her owner continued to harass her, and she sought refuge in a crawlspace where she lived in hiding. After her escape to the North, she published her narrative.<br> </p> <p><br> </p> <p>John S. Jacobs &#x201c;walked away&#x201d; as he put it, from his owner, a congressman. He sailed on a whaling ship and educated himself. He then became a paid agent of the Anti-Slavery Society, made a lecturing trip with Frederick Douglass, and finally settled in London, where he remained until it was safe for a fugitive to return to the North. He wrote his story for a London Sunday school journal where it was published in 1861.</p>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition combines the two most important African American slave narratives into one volume. <br>Frederick Douglass's Narrative, first published in 1845, is an enlightening and incendiary text. Born into slavery, Douglass became the preeminent spokesman for his people during his life; his narrative is an unparalleled account of the dehumanizing effects of slavery and Douglass's own triumph over it. Like Douglass, Harriet Jacobs was born into slavery, and in 1861 she published Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, now recognized as the most comprehensive antebellum slave narrative written by a woman. Jacobs's account broke the silence on the exploitation of African American female slaves, and it remains crucial reading. These narratives illuminate and inform each other. This edition includes an incisive Introduction by Kwame Anthony Appiah and extensive annotations. <p>"From the Trade Paperback edition.</p></p><h2>The Goodly Spellbook: Olde Spells for Modern Problems</h2><p>This is not your average mystical tome&#x2014;but a special spellbook by two practicing witches.<br>Here is the thoroughly comprehensive, absolutely definitive guide to spells&#x2014;the basic handbook for anyone looking to practice some hands-on magic. Delightfully well written and practical, filled with atmospheric illustrations and diagrams throughout, it encompasses all the principles and philosophy of spell casting, and gives recipes for charms to solve common contemporary problems. This offers what most witchcraft and Wicca books don't: an in-depth understanding of what's behind the spells and why they work. It's amazing how much magic is in here: Geomancy, Elemental Scrying, Tree Divination, Mystic Dance and Drumming, Kitchen Witchery, and lots more. From healing, protection, and attraction spells to spells for discernment, repulsion, and concealing, not a topic goes uncovered.</p><p>Lady Passion (Dixie Deerman), RN, NLC, HPS, is a seer, counselor, and registered nurse with more than three decades' experience as a clairvoyant psychic reader, divination expert, and healer for clients from every continent and every walk of life. &nbsp;Steve Rasmussen (*Diuvei) is High Priest of Coven Oldenwilde. His magical specialties are astrology, music, and wordcraft&#x2014;each of which he has also plied in the mundane world as a professional astrologer, computer musicologist, and journalist for an alt-weekly newspaper.The authors, Gardernian witches and co-founders of Coven Oldenwilde, offer hundreds of spell recipes for healing, protection, discernment, concealment, repulsion of evil and attraction of good (not just romance, but also prosperity, fertility and wisdom). Before they get to the spells, however, they lay a solid foundation for practice with an introductory essay on the history of spellcraft, followed by short sections on practical matters like gathering ingredients, creating a magical atmosphere and living ethically. They also delve into specific magical techniques such as geomancy, chanting and kitchen witchery. Beginners will appreciate hands-on chapters like "How to Know You're Doing Spells Properly"-successful spells, the authors say, often make the caster's ears ring and spark an "inner tingling." The spells are presented in a straightforward manner with specifics on the best times to cast them, the necessary ingredients and the right deity to invoke. Some spells are quotidian, even prosaic-such as a compress to heal computer eyestrain-while others are momentous and difficult, like a spell to prevent evil people from entering a home or workspace. Well-organized and comprehensively indexed, this reference book will be useful for beginners and experienced practitioners alike.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Adapted from talks given by Fr. Carr�n, these essays have been thoroughly reworked by the author to offer an organic presentation of a decade-long journey. They present the content of his elaboration of the gospel message in light of the tradition of Fr. Giussani, the teachings of the popes, and the urgent needs of contemporary people.</p><br><br><p>Carr�n offers a broad diagnosis of challenges in society and then introduces their implications in contexts such as families, schools, workplaces, and political communities. In a dialogue with his listeners, he inspires and encourages them to lay out a new path for the Catholic church and the world. Throughout his essays, Carr�n addresses the most pressing questions facing theologians today and provides insights that will interest everyone, from the most devout to the firm nonbeliever. Grappling with the interaction of Christian faith and modern culture, Carr�n treats in very real and concrete ways what is essential to maintaining and developing Christian faith, and he invites an ongoing conversation about the meaning of faith, truth, and freedom.</p></p><p>Juli�n Carr�n is a Catholic priest and theologian from Spain. He is president of the Fraternity of Communion and Liberation, the successor to Father Luigi Giussani, who passed away in 2005. Carr�n is professor of theology at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan. He is the editor of <i>Christ, God's Companionship with Man</i> by Luigi Giussani."Given [Rod] Dreher&#x2019;s alarming call to do 'battle in the modern world,' Juli�n Carr�n&#x2019;s new book, <i>Disarming Beauty</i>, which asks Christians to lay down their arms and enter the public square with joy and confidence, may seem wildly na�ve. Yet Carr�n&#x2019;s argument deserves careful consideration by Christians attracted to the Benedict Option. . . . Carr�n shares similar anxieties about the modern spiritual crisis of 'nihilism.' . . . But, in sharp contrast to Dreher, Carr�n does not think Christians should disown contemporary society as a new 'Dark Age.' . . . Over and over again, Carr�n seems to ask: If Christianity is true, what do Christians really have to fear?" (America)<br><br>"Already garnering some notable attention since its release, a new book by Fr. Carron called <i>Disarming Beauty</i> takes on the question of the Church's relevance amid modern society's most pressing challenges. From terrorism to consumerism, 'rights' culture to marriage and family, the book examines the plight of our current world and invites Christians to respond&#x2015;not from a place of fear, but from the joy of their original encounter with the living person of Christ." (<i>Catholic News Agency</i>)<br><br>"With brilliant and simple to-the-point analysis, Fr. Carr�n shows how the situation today of our alienation from our own experience has very much to do with a variety of contemporary social phenomena: the proliferation of new rights, the expansion of diverse cultures and religions within Western societies, challenges to religious freedom, confusion about the purpose of education, the reduction of human beings to objects according to biological and economic definitions and categories, the difficulty of motivating young people, and developments in family life. At the same time, with constant reference to the writings of Fr. Luigi Giussani, John Paul II, Joseph Ratizinger/Benedict XVI, Pope Francis, and a variety of other thinkers and writers, Fr. Carr�n shows how the encounter with the fascinating presence of Jesus Christ, through the Church, offers us exactly what we need to regain a true sense of ourselves, engage with reality as it is, and become protagonists in our own lives." (Stephen E. Lewis, Franciscan University)<br><br>"Fr. Carr�n reminds us in <i>Disarming Beauty</i> that Christianity is not a set of concepts or ethical prescriptions but an encounter with a person. He echoes Pope Francis in asking us 'to think of reality first as beautiful, and only later as good and true.' This is the meaning of the incarnation: that Beauty is made flesh." (John Garvey, president, The Catholic University of America)<br><br>"Carr�n plumbs the depths of Western Christian precepts and practice as he presents the historical and present context of spiritual life in economics, politics, and culture. Young people have been robbed of transforming personal growth in education. Global terrorism and consumerism are threatening all humanity. Readers will be drawn to profound contemplation concerning his treatment of faith, truth, and freedom as he tries to make sense of the many influences that oppose the Christian faith." (<i>Christian Market Magazine</i>)<br><br>More social criticism than formal theology, this book attacks bankrupt European culture head-on, urging a reinvigorated, theologically informed understanding of education, human relationships, and questions of meaning. The testimony, [Carr�n] claims, that all Christians are called to is to affirm the value of others and the common good above our own prejudiced concerns." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"In <i>Disarming Beauty</i>, Juli�n Carr�n addresses the most pressing questions facing theologians today and provides insights that will interest everyone, from the most devout to the firm nonbeliever. Grappling with the interaction of Christian faith and modern culture, Carr�n treats in very real and concrete ways what is essential to maintaining and developing Christian faith, and he invites an ongoing conversation about the meaning of faith, truth, and freedom." (Vatican Insider)<br><br>"When Christianity is reduced to a mere set of precepts or dogmas, living out one&#x2019;s faith could be perceived as a burden, and the faith could seem to be something not connected to 'real life.' But when the faith is lived out as a relationship that began with an encounter with a person that we find so fascinating that we couldn&#x2019;t imagine living another moment without Him, it becomes a thing of beauty, says the president of the Fraternity of Communion and Liberation, Father Juli�n Carr�n." (<i>Denver Catholic</i>)<br><br>"'Speak softly but carry a big message' is one way of conveying the spirit and content of this important book and of its author. The book is a worthy successor to Luigi Giussani's The Religious Sense and the author a worthy successor at the helm of the Communion and Liberation Movement." (Joseph Weiler, University Professor, NYU School of Law)<br><br>"Juli�n Carr�n&#x2019;s <i>Disarming Beauty</i> inserts itself in the ever growing literature of reflections about the role of Christianity in contemporary society. [Father] Carr�n&#x2019;s contribution to the debate is a welcome addition, for it represents a unique perspective that defies the usual ideological camps that characterize much of the current conversation."

Not to mention a shelf filled with dust-covered devotionals.<br>Is that true for you as well?<br>Maybe you&#x2019;ve discovered, as I have, that most of your New Year&#x2019;s resolutions have little effect on day-to-day life except to add a burden of guilt and a feeling of failure. Continually striving, yet never arriving. Hoping, praying to<br>be different, only waking up to find you&#x2019;re not as far along as you&#x2019;d hoped to be. Sometimes feeling like you&#x2019;re right back where you started&#x2014;again!<br>I know. I&#x2019;ve felt that way too.<br>In fact it was one of those discouraging moments that prompted me to write this book.<br><br><b>LEARNING FROM MARY AND MARTHA<br><br></b>It all began about seven years ago, with two sisters I&#x2019;d met in the Bible&#x2014;Mary and Martha of Bethany.<br>As a pastor&#x2019;s wife and&#x2014;at the time&#x2014;the mother of two almost-teenagers, my life was busy and often crazy. There was so much to do and so little time. Yet while I tended toward drivenness, my heart longed for intimacy with God. Maybe that&#x2019;s why I was drawn to take a new look at the story that had intrigued me for years. Luke 10:38&#x2013;42 reads:<br><br>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord&#x2019;s feet listening to what he said. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, &#x201c;Lord, don&#x2019;t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Martha, Martha,&#x201d; the Lord answered, &#x201c;you are worried and upset about many things, but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.&#x201d;<br>After hearing several hundred sermons on these two women, I assumed the meaning was fairly straightforward. Mary was the heroine. Martha was the villain. And too much of the time I was Martha! I felt the Lord convicting me of my tendency to rush around, busy with &#x201c;many things&#x201d; while ignoring the &#x201c;one thing&#x201d; that was needed&#x2014;to sit at Jesus&#x2019;s feet.<br>But as I studied the rest of the sisters&#x2019; story in John 11 and 12, I discovered something so beautiful, so amazing, that I felt compelled to share it in a book. For I saw two women change before my eyes, both of them experiencing a holy makeover when they encountered the living Lord.<br>And so, six years ago, <i>Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World: Finding Intimacy with God in the Busyness of Life </i>was born.<br>Perhaps the most comforting thing I learned as I worked on that book was that none of us has it all together. Even on our best days and with our best intentions, we all eventually blow it. We start out operating in our gifts and<br>talents&#x2014;excited to be serving the Messiah&#x2014;only to have our efforts morph into a full-blown pity party when we don&#x2019;t get enough help, or we aren&#x2019;t appreciated, or someone else gets the attention we <i>know </i>we deserve.<br>But what stood out most to me was the fact that when Jesus scolded Martha about her busyness, He wasn&#x2019;t condemning her efficiency and hard work or her can-do personality. He wasn&#x2019;t telling her she had to be just like<br>Mary to please Him. Jesus simply didn&#x2019;t want Martha to be so caught up in kitchen service <i>for</i>Him that she missed out on the joy of living-room intimacy <i>with </i>Him.<br>Jesus challenged Mary as well in John 11. When her brother, Lazarus, was sick and dying, Jesus waited two days before making His way to Bethany. By then, Lazarus was dead. And Mary, apparently paralyzed by grief, declined to go out to meet Jesus and stayed in the house instead. Later, she cried out her questions to Him. But while Jesus didn&#x2019;t answer her, He felt her pain. The Bible tells us He wept.<br>Neither Mary nor Martha got what they expected from Jesus. Instead, they received much more. For God never withholds good except when He has something better to give. Whether it&#x2019;s refusing more help in the kitchen or the miraculous healing of your brother, you can be sure Jesus knows what He&#x2019;s doing when He says no to our earthly requests in order to say yes to His heavenly plan.<br>But these two sisters had to accept Christ&#x2019;s better way&#x2014;for it was a choice. Only as they humbled their hearts and learned from Him were they changed. Martha learned to be still and listen. Mary learned to pour out her heart as well as her expensive perfume in service. As they received Jesus&#x2019;s teaching, they learned the balance between a soul at rest and a body in motion,2 between working for hard for Christ and sitting at His feet.<br>And I was learning right along with them. My Marthalike tendencies were being tempered by the tender grace of God. Because I no longer felt as if I had to earn the Father&#x2019;s favor, I was finally able to enjoy His lavish love. Rather than striving, I was learning what John 15&#x2019;s abiding in the vine really means. As a result, like Mary and Martha, I, too, was being changed.<br>I&#x2019;m so glad we have a Savior who loves us just as we are, but loves us too much to leave us that way. After all, Christ&#x2019;s main purpose is to return to us the glory of God we were meant to reflect in this world. As author Donna Partow puts it: &#x201c;Our task here on earth is to show the world an accurate reflection of what God is like. To show them, through our lives, who God is.&#x201d;3<br>In other words, the whole purpose of our holy makeover is to make us more and more like Jesus. But that divine transformation only happens as we choose to have a Mary spirit and accept the Lord&#x2019;s rebuke. Even when it hurts.<br><b>BRICK WALLS AND LEARNING CURVES<br><br></b>After completing <i>Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World, </i>I decided to take a six-month sabbatical. After being &#x201c;spilled&#x201d; out in my writing, I knew I needed time to be refilled.<br>I had no idea six months would turn into six years.<br>Not that they were barren years. No, far from that! During that time God taught me so much. He walked me through some valleys and up some mountaintops. I had the privilege of watching my son, John Michael, and my daughter, Jessica, grow up into wonderful young people. Then, three years ago, God surprised us with a baby we named Joshua&#x2014;a truly unexpected blessing. Plus, our growing church purchased land, and we were finally ready to build our new facility&#x2014;the one that had been years in the dreaming.<br>But it was that dream-coming-true that showed me just how far I still had to go. It also birthed this sequel. A book I didn&#x2019;t know existed.<br>I was so certain I was on the right track with the church building project. As the daughter of a part-time contractor, I was familiar with the construction process. As plans progressed, I discovered in myself a vision and a passion I hadn&#x2019;t felt in a long time.<br>With the official launch of our fund-raising just weeks away, I was running full tilt. There was so much to do&#x2014;floor plans to finalize, brochures to design, numbers to crunch. I&#x2019;d go to bed thinking about all the details and<br>wake up with a focused energy and purpose that propelled me through my to-do list and beyond. It felt wonderful to be doing something for the Lord..<br>My pastor husband, John, tried to warn me. &#x201c;Honey, I think you need to slow down. You&#x2019;re going to burn out.&#x201d; Of course I should have listened. My husband, unlike me, is not inclined to give his opinion 24/7. I should have realized that God was trying to get my attention through my spiritual covering.<br>But I brushed away John&#x2019;s concern.<br>Sure, this was a crazy time, I told myself. Getting a ball rolling takes a lot of effort. I&#x2019;d slow down later.<br>I slowed down, all right. Brick walls have that effect on people.<br>The brick wall, in this case, was a lack of funding. We were unable to raise enough pledges to complete the project, and we felt strongly that we were not to borrow funds. Plans would have to be scaled back. So many dreams and ministries we&#x2019;d envisioned launching would have to be downsized as well. I tried my best to hang on to the initial vision. My Martha fix-it mode kicked in, and I scrambled to come up with ways to still fulfill the dream. Butevery option I came up with was discarded and, to be honest, my insistence began to wear on people.<br>Finally, I had to admit that God must have other things in mind. The vibrant passion I&#x2019;d had for the project began to dwindle as discouragement and disappointment flooded in to take its place.<br>&#x201c;Why, God? I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; I wailed. &#x201c;I so wanted to do this right. What did I do wrong?&#x201d;<br>In that moment this book was born.<br><b>THE MARTHA IN ME<br></b><i>Joanna, </i>I sensed the Lord whisper to my tired soul. <i>You have a Martha spirit. You&#x2019;re a good girl wanting to do the right thing. But sometimes you do it the wrong way.<br></i>A Martha spirit? Oh, man. I knew what that meant. Martha was trying to reassert herself in my life. Not the grown-up, lesson-learned, Jesus-changed Martha we meet near the end of the Gospels, but the old Martha. The highoctane, high-anxiety, chronically overachieving woman Jesus had to rebuke at her own dinner party. The Martha who loved the Lord but just couldn&#x2019;t be bothered to actually listen to Him. Who kept rushing in to do things her way and complaining loudly whenever anyone dared do things differently. She was the Martha I thought I&#x2019;d left behind&#x2014;but she seemed to be running the show once again.<br><i>When you run ahead of Me, </i>the Lord impressed on my heart, <i>you end up doing what I&#x2019;ve asked you to do in your own strength rather than Mine. Instead of being cloaked in the sweetness of My Spirit, your efforts are cloaked in your flesh. And sometimes, my dear daughter, your flesh ain&#x2019;t that easy to receive.<br></i>It was hard to hear, but I knew it was true. My woman-on-a-mission mode was rarely attractive. While I always strived to keep a sweet demeanor on the outside, my inner spirit&#x2014;my heart attitude&#x2014;often had an edge to it.<br>Especially when I was busy. Especially when I was tired. Especially when things didn&#x2019;t go my way. You can only imagine the cosmic repercussions when the planets of those three <i>especially&#x2019;</i>s happened to align!<br>What made the truth even harder to bear was that I had learned&#x2014;or thought I&#x2019;d learned&#x2014;this lesson before. More than once, in fact. It was the same truth God had sought to teach me back at the beginning of our ministry. And again shortly after I finished <i>Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World, </i>when a misunderstanding led to a painful falling-out with friends.<br>Now here I was once again. Facing the same old flaws in myself. Struggling with a Martha spirit that continually tried to overshadow my Mary heart.<br>&#x201c;Lord, change me,&#x201d; I prayed in all sincerity.<br>But, I must confess, with my repentance came an underlying fear. After so many years of being taught the same lesson over and over, would I ever be truly changed? Was lasting transformation even possible?<br>I knew in my heart it was. After all, I had experienced God&#x2019;s hand in my life over the years. But how would it happen now? And how could I better cooperate with the process?<br><i>You need a Mary spirit, </i>the Lord whispered. And once again, in the quiet of that moment, I understood what He meant.<br>A Mary spirit is not a personality type. It isn&#x2019;t about being an extrovert versus an introvert or an active person versus a more contemplative type. Having a Mary spirit is about our attitude toward what God wants to do in our lives. The spirit behind our response to Him makes all the difference.<br>Mary of Bethany seemed to have a Mary spirit from the beginning. And although it took the tough love of Christ, her sister Martha eventually had it too. But there are two other Marys I want to mention (both of whom we&#x2019;ll<br>discuss in greater detail later)&#x2014;women who shared with Mary of Bethany not only a name, but also the grace- filled peace of a heart in tune with God.<br>First, Mary, the mother of Jesus, displayed a willing Mary spirit when she told the angel Gabriel, &#x201c;Let it be to me according to your word.&#x201d; Although everything within her must have balked at the implications of mothering the<br>very Son of God, and although she must have known in her heart that doing so would be costly, still she said yes to God&#x2019;s plan.<br>Second, Mary Magdalene exhibited the gratefulness of a Mary spirit after Jesus set her free from seven demons. Rather than settling down to a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; life, she abandoned it all in order to follow the One who had brought her out of darkness and into His marvelous light. That grateful and persistent love for the Lord, that desire to always be near Him and follow wherever He leads&#x2014; that&#x2019;s also part of a Mary spirit.<br>And that, I realized, is what I wanted.<br><i>You see, Joanna, </i>the Lord seemed to be saying, <i>I delight in a heart that welcomes My work rather than resents it. A willing, teachable spirit is all I&#x2019;m looking for. A life so surrendered to Me, I can do My work unhindered.<br></i>As God began to work these truths in my life, I realized this was the book He&#x2019;d had me wait six years to write. For just as <i>Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World </i>shows us how to make room in our outer lives for intimacy with God, <i>Having a Mary Spirit </i>is meant to show us how to give God access to the deep, hidden corners of our hearts. Those dark, sin-ridden parts of our lower nature that continually cause us to stumble when we so desperately want to walk in the light. Those secret, not-so-silent kingdoms Christ came to conquer as well as redeem. So that we can be made holy as He is holy. Changed from the inside out.<br><br><b><br></b>I don&#x2019;t know your situation. I don&#x2019;t know what God is walking you through right now. But I suspect He&#x2019;s been stirring in you a divine discontentment&#x2014; a hunger for something more, a desire to <i>be </i>something more. Otherwise you wouldn&#x2019;t have picked up this book. May I tell you that such spiritual discontentment is a gift from God? For<br>He only stirs us when He wants to change us. He only makes us feel uneasy with where we are so we&#x2019;re willing to do whatever it takes to get where He is.<br>So if you&#x2019;re feeling those discontented stirrings, if you&#x2019;re tired of taking one step forward only to fall two steps back, if you, like me, would like to stop learning the same lessons over and over again, then I&#x2019;d like to invite you to join me on an adventure of change.<br>And I can&#x2019;t think of a better place to start than with this prayer:<br>Lord Jesus, I give You my life.<br>I invite You to have Your way in me.<br>Take me and break me. Shake me and make me.<br>Fill me and spill me. Change me and rearrange me.<br>...</p><h2>Illustrated Shakespeare: Romeo &amp; Juliet</h2><p>Artwork by a celebrated Edwardian painter enhances an edition of Shakespeare&#39;s classic love story</p><p></p><h2>Surprise, Security, and the American Experience (The Joanna Jackson Goldman Memorial Lectures on American Civilization and Government)</h2><p><p>September 11, 2001, distinguished Cold War historian John Lewis Gaddis argues, was not the first time a surprise attack shattered American assumptions about national security and reshaped American grand strategy. We've been there before, and have responded each time by dramatically expanding our security responsibilities.</p><p>The pattern began in 1814, when the British attacked Washington, burning the White House and the Capitol. This early violation of homeland security gave rise to a strategy of unilateralism and preemption, best articulated by John Quincy Adams, aimed at maintaining strength beyond challenge throughout the North American continent. It remained in place for over a century. Only when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 did the inadequacies of this strategy become evident: as a consequence, the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt devised a new grand strategy of cooperation with allies on an intercontinental scale to defeat authoritarianism. That strategy defined the American approach throughout World War II and the Cold War.</p><p>The terrorist attacks of 9/11, Gaddis writes, made it clear that this strategy was now insufficient to ensure American security. The Bush administration has, therefore, devised a new grand strategy whose foundations lie in the nineteenth-century tradition of unilateralism, preemption, and hegemony, projected this time on a global scale. How successful it will be in the face of twenty-first-century challenges is the question that confronts us. This provocative book, informed by the experiences of the past but focused on the present and the future, is one of the first attempts by a major scholar of grand strategy and international relations to provide an answer.</p></p><p>John Lewis Gaddis is Robert A. Lovett Professor of History and Political Science at Yale University.Gaddis presents an important discussion on America's response to September 11 in this extraordinarily thoughtful and challenging new book. (Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State, 1973-1977)<br><br>Many academics disgraced themselves in the 1980s, predicting that Ronald Reagan's foreign policy would lead to nuclear confrontation, when in fact it led to the destruction of world communism. Academics may be committing the same blunder regarding President Bush. Prof. Gaddis is too smart to fall into that trap. He judges the current president from the standpoint of America's own foreign policy history, and the results are surprising, indeed. Whatever the fates hold in store for President Bush, this little nugget of a book is destined for a long shelf life. (Robert D. Kaplan, author of <i>Warrior Politics: Why Leadership Demands a Pagan Ethos</i>)<br><br>John Gaddis brings light to issues now generating heat. He scores the historic ignorance of those who claim that the Bush Administration's 'grand 'strategy' is without precedent in our past. He links current national security with long-standing themes. At the same time, he demonstrates just how unprecedented is the current moment. <i>Surprise, Security, and the American Experience</i> is a small gem of clarity and coherence. (Jean Bethke Elshtain, author of <i>Just War Against Terror: The Burden of American Power in a Violent World</i>)<br><br>The post-September 11 strategy of the Bush administration is often described as a radical departure from U.S. policy. Gaddis, one of America's leading scholars of foreign policy and international relations, provocatively demonstrates that, to the contrary, the principles of preemption, unilateralism and hegemony go back to the earliest days of the republic...The events of September 11 extended the concept of preemptive action even at the expense of sovereignty when terrorism is involved. Gaddis describes this latest expansion of American power in response to surprise attack as a volatile mixture of prudence and arrogance. But instead of the usual caveats, he recommends the U.S. continue on an interventionist course...This compact, provocative history of an idea-in-action has the potential to alter the U.S.'s collective self-image. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2004-01-26)<br><br>Gaddis argues that George W. Bush in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq attempted FDR's exploitation of multilateralism but ultimately elected preemption ('shock and awe') in the service of global hegemony. Even Bush's staunchest opponents stand to be edified by Gaddis' impressive presentation. (Ray Olson <i>Booklist</i> 2004-02-15)<br><br>Gaddis...points out that three salient elements of the Bush security strategy--pre-emption, unilateralism and hegemony--have deep roots in the country's history. When threatened, Americans have typically taken the offensive rather than hide behind a static defense...Throughout his essays, Gaddis employs a judicious tone and avoids categorical or simplistic answers. He recognizes that the United States faces a different sort of threat from those of the cold war and earlier. Traditional deterrence and balance-of-power policies are inadequate to confront the devil's brew of failed states, rogue regimes, suicidal terrorists and proliferating weapons of mass destruction. (Jack F. Matlock Jr. <i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2004-03-21)<br><br>The clarity of Mr. Gaddis's writing matching the clarity of his arguments. Each chapter of <i>Surprise, Security, and the American Experience</i> is itself a well-rounded essay, perhaps reflecting the fact that they were public lectures, and their simplicity underscores their depth. Though this is a small book, it is a book of big ideas; in these times, those are of surpassing value. (Thomas Donnelly <i>New York Sun</i> 2004-03-22)<br><br>This book is a persuasive account of the Bush administration's grand strategy and demonstrates the power of strategic analysis drawn from the American national experience...Gaddis' focus on U.S. foreign policy and history gives him powerful tools that he exploits to the fullest, elucidating the similarities between the strategies of John Quincy Adams and Franklin Roosevelt, which have shaped the evolution of U.S. power, and contrasting both with the emerging grand strategy of the Bush administration...A strategy, Gaddis notes, may be grand without being successful, and he asks some tough questions about the validity of the assumptions on which the Bush strategy rests...<i>Surprise, Security, and the American Experience</i> is a substantive accomplishment and a valuable contribution to the most important debates of our time. (Walter Russell Mead <i>Foreign Affairs</i> 2004-05-01)<br><br><i>Surprise, Security, and the American Experience</i> has the virtue of being genuinely original, rather than merely clever, and is at once dispassionate and public spirited. Anyone wanting to understand the deepest intellectual and historical sources behind Bush's foreign policy, as opposed to all the blather about 'neocon cabals,' should pick up Gaddis's book. (Adam Wolfson <i>The Weekly Standard</i> 2004-04-26)<br><br>John Lewis Gaddis's excellent <i>Surprise, Security, and the American Experience</i> is a short book with a long view. Gaddis compares foreign policy reactions to three attacks on America--the British burning of Washington in 1814, the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. This is no humdrum recounting of familiar events. In addition to giving a brilliant short course in American diplomatic history, Gaddis offers a big surprise: George W. Bush's foreign policy post-Sept. 11, which Gaddis calls pre-emptive, unilateral and hegemonic, is as American as apple pie.

The book contained legal briefs, pamphlets, and letters relating to a case that had been tried in 1698 involving a child bride, a disguised priest, a triple murder, four hangings and the beheading of a nobleman.

Anne Volokh, a Russian food writer who eventually emigrated to the U.S., enlivens her work by including passages from Russian literature and historical works. She concentrates on authentic cooking, often drawing recipes from A Gift to Young Housewives written by Ellena Molokhovets in the 1870s. The result brings to life how Russians ate when their rivers ran thick with fish and aristocrats had French chefs invent elaborate dishes like Veal Orloff, made with two creamy sauces.<p> Naturally, Volokh starts with <i>zakuski</i>, the antipasto-like ceremony that can constitute a meal in itself; including herring, caviar, salads, even suckling pig in aspic. For soups, there are peasant-hearty borschts--which are actually Ukrainian, not Russian--and spicy Selianka, an example of upper-class cooking. In Russia, each soup has a proper garnish or accompaniment; Volokh provides them all, from sliced eggs in cold borscht to yeasty garlic rolls with the hot kind. Dishes such as Beef Stroganoff, Stuffed Cabbage, proper Bliny and Pashka (the sweetened cheese dessert), require culinary expertise, great patience, or both to make. But dishes such as Roasted Chicken with Raisin-Studded Stuffing and Baked Trout with Walnut-Based Satsivi Sauce are simple but rich. </p><p> If Russian food interests you, <i>The Art of Russian Cuisine</i> is worth having for its traditional recipes and the enlightening exploration of their origins. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p></p><h2>The Vocabulary Guide to Biblical Hebrew</h2><p>A Hebrew vocabulary guide that gives the student everything he or she needs in order to master basic Hebrew vocabulary and to expand knowledge of biblical Hebrew.

The Stooges are comedy icons whose enduring appeal and slapstick legacy have made them one of the most famous and beloved comedy troupes in the world. Michael Fleming's <b>The Three Stooges</b><b>TM</b> is the first complete, authorized biography of the men who made pie fights part of our national cultural heritage.<br><br>A juggernaut of wise guys, headlocks, and unforgettable insults, this book tells the whole history of the Stooges, starting with their origins in the golden years of vaudeville, when the boys from Brooklyn honed their craft. Moe, Curly, and Shemp Howard were born Moses, Jerome, and Samuel Horwitz--and were believed for many years to be the three least accomplished sons of their Lithuanian immigrant parents. Ultimately, of course, the Three Stooges reinvented the rules of slapstick comedy: never be caught unprepared in a pie fight, never slap one wise guy in the face if you can slap three in a row, and never underestimate the value of a good poke in the eye.<br><br>Signed in 1934 by Columbia Pictures to a renewable contract that had them making at least nine short films a year, the Stooges learned firsthand about the sharks swimming through Hollywood's early waters. And after nearly a quarter century of producing the short films for which the Stooges are so well known and loved, the studio declined to renew their contract in 1954, and the pioneering pie-throwing professionals lost their jobs. Fittingly, though, Moe &amp; Co. were destined to have the last laugh: the advent of television revived their careers after the decline of vaudeville and Hollywood shorts, and a new generation of belly laughs was born.<br><br>From the Stooges' humble origins to movie stardom to comedy legends, there's something here for every level of fan--from folks who watched them on television as a kid to Stooge scholars and certified "knuckleheads." Featuring over two hundred photographs, many of them rare; interviews with Stooge friends and families; and a complete filmography with every "woob-woob" and crashed society cocktail party lovingly detailed, this book will be treasured by all Stoogedom.</p><p>The Three Stooges are admittedly an acquired taste. To fully appreciate them, as with NASCAR racing, practical jokes, and Steely Dan, it helps to be a guy. But there's no denying the durability of the Stooges' fearless physical performances. Every eye poke, noggin crack, face slap, and nyuk-nyuk-nyuk feels as edgy today as it did in their earliest two-reelers, and it's safe to say that their routines, for better or worse, helped pave the way for the Farrelly brothers, the Zucker brothers, Adam Sandler, and Jim Carrey.<p> Michael Fleming, a columnist for <i>Daily Variety</i>, has diligently compiled the history of the Stooges, from their vaudeville days through the height of their fame in the '30s to the '50s and beyond. What <i>An Illustrated History</i> lacks in clear organization it more than makes up for in attention to detail, about the lives of Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard (plus the other "third Stooges," Shemp Howard, Joe Besser, and Curly Joe DeRita); the genesis of their routines; and the heavy-handed business deals that left them, the most successful comedians of their day, with virtually no residual income. The book's best segment dissects each two-reeler and film (including <i>Men in Black</i>, the only Stooge short to be nominated for an Oscar), with a wealth of publicity photos and a tally of slaps, eye pokes, and head conks. Might Fleming make even non-Stooge fans appreciate their humor? Why, <i>soitenly</i>. <i>--Anne Hurley</i></p>Michael Fleming is a columnist for Variety who lives in New York State. <b>The Three Stooges</b><b>TM</b> is his first book.</p><h2>Anatomy and Physiology for the Manual Therapies</h2><p><i>Anatomy &amp; Physiology for the Manual Therapies</i> 1e is designed to meet the specific needs of students preparing for careers in the manual therapies, such as massage therapy and careers as physical therapy assistants.

He has been a newspaperman in New York City for nearly forty years.Obituaries tell us not only about who died, but who lived -- and how. In reading them we discover that some of the lives that have had the most impact on our own were lived by men and women we have never heard of. Other lives have had an impact that is small or even nil, but seem to suggest something large or telling about what it is to be human in a particular place and time. <p>Few people had a greater impact on the way we live now than J. Presper Eckert, Jr., and John W. Mauchly, who are regarded as the principal developers of the computer. Their pioneering work changed the world forever, but when they died they were hardly household names, even in the households in which their invention has become a common appliance.</p><p>Maggie Kuhn, who had worked twenty-five years for the United Presbyterian Church in New York, commuting daily from her home in Philadelphia, reached the mandatory retirement age of sixty-five and was forced to leave her job in 1970. "They gave me a sewing machine," she recalled, "but I never opened it. I was too busy." Within months of her retirement, she was organizing the Gray Panther movement to campaign against age discrimination. </p><p>Anne Scheiber had no close family and no friends. She had no projects, no charities, did no volunteer work. She lived simply and cared nothing about possessions. After she retired a half century ago from the Internal Revenue Service, she devoted herself to the stock market, turning her $5,000 savings into a $22 million portfolio. She lived reclusively until she was 101, and when she died, she left her entire fortune to Yeshiva University -- an institution with which she had no direct contact -- to set up scholarships for needy women students. </p><p>J. Prosper Eckert, Jr., and John W. Mauchly, Maggie Kuhn and Anne Scheiber, are among the hundred or so men and women you will meet in the pages of this celebratory book. They had little in common except that they were Americans and that when they died their lives were illuminated in obituaries and farewells in <i>The New York Times.</i> These brief and elegantly written accounts of their time on earth -- however glorious or humble, happy or sad, long or short -- evoke laughter or tears or wonder at the astonishing variety of human experience. At least that is what I thought when I chose them from among the thousands of obituaries and farewells that have appeared in The Times since the early 1980s.</p><p></p><p>The selection process was quite personal. I responded largely to storytelling that was lively, that stimulated or moved me or made me smile. I particularly enjoyed reading about the remarkable life of someone I had never encountered before and feeling that with his or her passing, the world had become a duller place. I also rooted for people who sustained hardships and came out all right in the end. I'm sure my reactions matched those of legions of Times readers who have discovered that the obit pages are the best read in the newspaper, invariably satisfying and even joyful on occasion. These readers understand that there's nothing morbid about a good obituary because a good obit is about life and not death. </p><p></p></p><h2>Quantum Physics (Idiot&#39;s Guides)</h2><p>Quantum physics explores the behavior of matter and energy at the molecular, atomic, nuclear, and even smaller levels. <i>Idiot's Guides: Quantum Physics</i> explores this very complex topic, while making it easy-to-understand for science enthusiasts and students alike.

Already such a prototype exists in sports, where advanced digital technology and multiple cameras all filming at once have produced live sporting events of extraordinary sophistication that are regularly viewed on one&#x2019;s television screen. But the time is not far off, <em>Live Cinema and Its Techniques</em> demonstrates, when a director or a collaborative team of filmmakers working across the internet will create "live" movies that will be sent <em>instantly</em> via satellite for viewing throughout the world.</p><p>Yet the creative demands posed by airing live sporting contests, as impressive as the final product is, pale in contrast with the ambitions of "cinematic auteurs," who are inspired by great directors, like Serge Eisenstein, Max Ophuls, or Alfred Hitchcock, among many others. As daunting as the challenge is, the process of integrating the highest artistic standards of previous generations into the medium of "live cinema" can, Coppola explains, be achieved, thus creating an entirely new art form for the so-called "screen." Tapping into his own encyclopedic knowledge of twentieth-century film history, Coppola threads his vision of this burgeoning cinematic medium with autobiographical and historical vignettes gleaned from the past, recalling his own boyhood obsession with film and his early fascination with the "Golden Age of Television," when 1950s viewers were treated to live productions of classics, like <em>Days of Wine and Roses</em> and <em>Requiem for a Heavyweight</em>.</p><p>Especially exciting is the exhilaration and drama that results from retraining actors and using a multitude of cameras to create a film that has the in-the-moment energy of a live event. Having already tried out this new medium with "proof-of-concept workshops" at Oklahoma City Community College and at UCLA, Coppola has created an invaluable guide for students and teachers alike. Filled with discussions of how to rehearse actors, how to choose scenery and location, and how to overcome theatrical, as well as technical, obstacles, <em>Live Cinema and Its Techniques</em> reveals how the spontaneity of this new genre can ultimately transport filmmaking into a new era of creativity still unimaginable today.</p><p>Featuring chapters on:</p><ul><li>A Short History of Film and Television</li><li>The Actors, Acting, and Rehearsal</li><li>The Question of Style in the Cinema</li><li>Obstacles and Other Thoughts on Live Cinema No Matter What They May Be</li><li>Equipment: Now and in the Near Future</li></ul> 20 illustrations</p><p>Francis Ford Coppola, the Academy Award&#x2013;winning director of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, is creating a four-part "live cinema" movie based on his own family&#x2019;s multigenerational history. He lives in San Francisco.&#x201c;In this surprising new book&#x2015;part memoir, part diary, part guide&#x2015;Francis Ford Coppola reenergizes himself and the reader with his search for a new way of storytelling.&nbsp;<em>Live Cinema and Its Techniques</em> blends&nbsp;elements of Coppola&#x2019;s autobiography, his encyclopedic knowledge of film and television, and his creative process toward a new language of cinema.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>William Friedkin</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is a gold mine of a book, intensely personal, and a rocket ride to the potential future of cinema/theater/television.&nbsp; It is simultaneously an intimate confessional and a magic key to the storehouse of Coppola&#x2019;s hard-won sixty years of wisdom about writing, directing, actors, rehearsals, and groundbreaking technique, and his visionary hopes for the cinematic language.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Walter Murch</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Invoking intimate details of his childhood, some that he&#x2019;s never shared before, Coppola conjures up the magic world of television in the 1950s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Readers interested in the new technology will find this an eminently user-friendly book, but it is also peppered with brilliant personal observations about the most basic principles and techniques of filmmaking that will also fascinate readers who have no interest in making live cinema but simply loved <em>The Godfather</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Wendy Doniger, author of <em>The Ring of Truth, and Other Myths of Sex and Jewelry</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Coppola&#x2019;s natural abilities as a storyteller, regardless of the medium, are evident here. Sections dealing with his relationship to the prehistory of live cinema are as personally revealing as they are fascinating. . . . This consummate filmmaker&#x2019;s enthusiasm for cinema is infectious.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Publishers Weekly</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A curious and exhilarating account of a master in his field wrestling with a new way to convey his vision. The book begins with an exploration into the history of television in its infancy, when nearly every program was brought to audiences live, and it is peppered throughout with personal asides about how this technique has dogged his entire career. . . . As in his films, Coppola knows how to tell a compelling story. Live cinema, in its new incarnation, and everyone it attracts, will benefit from his insights.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Ruzicka, <em>Booklist</em></strong></p><h2>The Buddha&#39;s Teachings on Social and Communal Harmony: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (The Teachings of the Buddha)</h2><p><b>In a world of conflict and strife, how can we be&nbsp;advocates of peace and justice?&nbsp;</b><br><br>In this volume acclaimed scholar-monk Bhikkhu Bodhi has collected and translated the Buddha&#x2019;s teachings&nbsp;on conflict resolution, interpersonal and social problem-solving, and the forging of harmonious relationships.

Chicago is a city of size and mass, the cradle of modern architecture, the freight hub of the nation, a city built on slaughterhouses and cacophonous financial trading tempered by some of the finest cultural institutions in the world. While many histories have been written of the city, none can claim the scope and breadth of the long-awaited <i>Encyclopedia of Chicago</i>.<br><br>Developed by the Newberry Library with the cooperation of the Chicago Historical Society, <i>The Encyclopedia of Chicago</i> is the definitive historical reference on metropolitan Chicago. More than a decade in the making, the <i>Encyclopedia</i> brings together hundreds of historians, journalists, and experts on everything from airlines to Zoroastrians to explore all aspects of the rich world of Chicagoland, from its geological prehistory to the present.<br><br>The main alphabetical section of the <i>Encyclopedia,</i> comprising more than 1,400 entries, covers the full range of Chicago's neighborhoods, suburbs, and ethnic groups, as well as the city's cultural institutions, technology and science, architecture, religions, immigration, transportation, business history, labor, music, health and medicine, and hundreds of other topics. The <i>Encyclopedia</i> has the widest geographical reach of any city encyclopedia of its kind, encompassing eight of the region's counties, including suburbs. Nearly 400 thumbnail maps pinpoint Chicago neighborhoods and suburban municipalities; these maps are complemented by hundreds of black-and-white and color photographs and thematic maps that bring the history of metropolitan Chicago to life. Additionally, contributors have provided lengthy interpretive essays&#x2014;woven into the alphabetical section but set off graphically&#x2014;that take a long view of such topics as the built environment, literary images of Chicago, and the city's often legendary and passionate sports culture.<br><br>The <i>Encyclopedia</i> also offers a comprehensive biographical dictionary of more than 2,000 individuals important to Chicago history and a detailed listing of approximately 250 of the city's historically significant business enterprises.

Besides encompassing Chicago history, ethnic groups, businesses, cultural institutions, sports, crime, architecture, religions, and other topics, the editors wanted to have the broadest geographic coverage. In addition to the 77 recognized Chicago neighborhoods, 298 suburban municipalities in the six surrounding counties in northern Illinois and two in northern Indiana are covered. Biographical entries of prominent Chicagoans are not included since these would duplicate information in such readily available sources as the <i>American National Biography</i> (Oxford, 1999) and <i>Woman Building Chicago, 1790-1990</i> (Indiana Univ., 2001). Instead there is a "Biographical Dictionary" at the end of the book that lists 2,000 deceased Chicagoans with short entries noting birth, death, and occupation. There is also a separate "Dictionary of Leading Chicago Businesses, 1820-2000" that offers brief historical summaries for 236 for-profit companies. Important companies are also discussed in entries on significant industry sectors such as <i>Clothing and garment manufacturing, Department stores, Iron and steel</i>, and <i>transportation</i>. These entries are very detailed and give a complete history of each industry and its place in Chicago. </p><p>The encyclopedia is set up in an <i>A-Z</i> format with three types of entries--broad essays of 1,000 to 4,000 words, midlevel entries of 200 to 1,000 words, and basic entries of 200 words. The broad essays give an overview and synthesize scholarship on a subject, while the basic entries focus on a specific event or institution and give brief information to identify what it is and why it is important. The midlevel entries are meant to fill in the gaps left by the broad essays and give more analysis than is found in the basic entries. All entries are signed and cross-referenced and list a bibliography of related books and articles for further reading. The work also features 21 long interpretative essays that reflect recent scholarship in urban history (for example, <i>Racism, ethnicity, and white identity; Street life</i>); numerous sidebars that offer varying viewpoints on different topics; a time line of Chicago history; a list of Chicago mayors; historical population statistics for all municipalities; several inserts with color photos and maps; and a comprehensive 60-page index. Fifty-six maps cover topics such as blues clubs in Chicago, Chicago's Deep Tunnel system, Indian settlement patterns in 1830, street railways in 1890, and movie theaters in Chicago in 1926, 1937, and 2002. A notable feature of the volume is the 400 thumbnail maps that show where each municipality and neighborhood is located in the Chicagoland region. </p><p>The scope of entries and their readability make the encyclopedia outstanding. All ideas, facts, people, and places are explained fully and in terms high-school and general readers can understand. This is a superb ready-reference work on Chicago, a good starting point for students doing research, and just a wonderful book to browse through. There is no other source that contains the breadth and depth of information found here. <i>The Encyclopedia of Chicago</i> is a must purchase for every academic, public, and school library in Illinois. Academic and large public libraries across the U.S. will want it as well. <i>Merle Jacob</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In The Man Called CASH, Steve Turner explores the legacy left by the man in black. With unflinchingly honesty, this biography reveals Cash anew, taking a candid look at the spiritual depth of the man who lived life as rough and gritty as his famous voice. <p>Cash&#x2019;s rise to stardom skyrocketed in the 1950&#x2019;s. Drug addictions, fits of rage, and shattered relationships marked his performances as a country singer. His craggy voice and haunting songs created music the world had never heard before. He was unafraid to explore the darkness within himself, and his lyrics shone with poetic depth. Delivered in a simple, direct style, Cash&#x2019;s rough-hewn music mesmerized the young and the old alike. </p><p>Born to a devout Christian mother and a father prone to dark, destructive moods, Cash grew up in poverty and knew hardships. But his mother helped him nurture his music as well as his faith in God. She taught him to use his musical talent for the Lord--a conviction that kept Cash going during the darkest days in his life. </p><p>While this book chronicles the details of this unforgettable musician&#x2019;s life&#x2014;including his brushes with the law&#x2014;Turner turns his keen pen toward unmistakable evidence of Cash&#x2019;s deep, enduring faith in God as well as his humble, unpretentious love for his family and his wife, June Carter Cash. </p><p>Whether you&#x2019;re one of the millions of Johnny Cash fans, a fellow Christian, or a pop culture aficionado, The Man Called CASH will inspire you with its heartfelt story of faith, hope, and redemption.</p>Steve Turner began his journalistic career as Features Editor of the British rock monthly Beat Instrumental where, during a two year period, he interviewed many of the key figures of early 1970s rock.

There were, after all, a tremendous number of traveling cases and <br>trunks. It took us two taxi rides from the apartment to the train station before <br>all the pieces could be accounted for. A small group of photographers, who <br>had gathered for the occasion, volunteered to watch over the first load while <br>we returned to the rue de Fleurus for more. My Mesdames accepted their <br>offer without hesitation. They had an almost childlike trust in photographers. <br>Photographers, my Mesdames believed, transformed an occasion into an <br>event. Their presence signaled that importance and fame had arrived, <br>holding each other"s hands. Their flashing cameras, like the brilliant smiles of <br>long-lost friends, had quickly warmed my Mesdames" collective heart. More <br>like friends too new to trust, I had thought. I had been with my Mesdames for <br>half a decade by then. The photographers had not been there from the very <br>beginning. But once the preparation for the journey began, they swarmed to <br>the entrance of 27 rue de Fleurus like honeybees. I could easily see why <br>my Mesdames cultivated them. Every visit by a photographer would be <br>inevitably followed by a letter enclosing a newspaper or magazine clipping <br>with my Mesdames" names circled in a halo of red ink. The clippings, each <br>carefully pressed with a heated iron, especially if a crease had thoughtlessly <br>fallen on my Mesdames" faces, went immediately into an album with a green <br>leather cover. "Green is the color of envy," my Mesdames told me. At this, <br>knowing looks shot back and forth between them, conveying what can only <br>be described as glee. My Mesdames communicated with each other in <br>cryptic ways, but after all my years in their company I was privy to their <br>keys. "Green" meant that they had waited desperately for this day, had tired <br>of seeing it arriving on the doorsteps of friends and mere acquaintances; <br>that the album had been there from the very beginning, impatient but biding <br>its time; that they were now thrilled to fill it with family photographs of the <br>most public kind. "Green" meant no longer their own but other people"s envy.<br> I know that it may be difficult to believe, but it took the arrival of <br>the photographers for me to understand that my Mesdames were not, well, <br>really mine; that they belonged to a country larger than any that I had ever <br>been to; that its people had a right to embrace and to reclaim them as one <br>of their own. Of course, 27 rue de Fleurus had always been filled with visitors, <br>but that was different. My Mesdames enjoyed receiving guests, but they <br>also enjoyed seeing them go. Many had arrived hoping for a permanent place <br>around my Mesdames" tea table, but I always knew that after the third pot <br>they would have to leave. My Mesdames had to pay me to stay around. A <br>delicious bit of irony, I had always thought. The photographers, though, <br>marked the beginning of something new. This latest crop of admirers was <br>extremely demanding and altogether inconsolable. They, I was stunned to <br>see, were not satisfied with knocking at the door to 27 rue de Fleurus, <br>politely seeking entrance to sip a cup of tea. No, the photographers wanted <br>my Mesdames to go away with them, to leave the rue de Fleurus behind, to <br>lock it up with a key. At the Gare du Nord that day, all I could think about <br>were the flashes of the cameras, how they had never stopped frightening <br>me. They were lights that feigned to illuminate but really intended to blind. <br>Lightning before a driving storm, I had thought. But I suppose that was the <br>sailor"s apprehension in me talking. It had been eleven years since I had <br>made a true ocean crossing. For my Mesdames, it had been over thirty. <br>The ocean for them was only a memory, a calming blue expanse between <br>here and there. For me it was alive and belligerent, a reminder of how <br>distance cannot be measured by the vastness of the open seas, that that <br>was just the beginning.<br> When my Mesdames first began preparing for the journey, they <br>had wanted to bring Basket and P�p� along with them. The SS Champlain <br>gladly accommodated dogs and assorted pets, just as long as they were <br>accompanied by a first-class owner. The problem, however, was America. <br>No hotels or at least none on their itinerary would accept traveling <br>companions of the four-legged kind. The discussion had been briefly tearful <br>but above all brief. My Mesdames had in recent years become practical. <br>Even the thought of their beloved poodle and Chihuahua languishing in Paris, <br>whimpering, or, in the case of the Chihuahua, yapping, for many months if <br>not years to come, even this could not postpone the journey home. There <br>was certainly no love lost between me and those dogs, the poodle Basket <br>especially. My Mesdames bought him in Paris at a dog show in the spring of <br>1929. Later that same year, I too joined the rue de Fleurus household. I have <br>always suspected that it was the closeness of our arrivals that made this <br>animal behave so badly toward me. Jealousy is instinctual, after all. Every <br>morning, my Mesdames insisted on washing Basket in a solution of sulfur <br>water. A cleaner dog could not have existed anywhere else. Visitors to the <br>rue de Fleurus often stopped in midsentence to admire Basket"s fur and its <br>raw-veal shade of pink. At first, I thought it was the sulfur water that had <br>altered the color of His Highness"s curly white coat. But then I realized that <br>he was simply losing his hair, that his sausage-casing skin had started to <br>shine through, an embarrassing peep show no doubt produced by his <br>morning baths. My Mesdames soon began "dressing" Basket in little <br>capelike outfits whenever guests were around.<br> I could wash and dress myself, thank you. Though, like Basket, I <br>too had a number of admirers. Well, maybe only one or two. P�p� the <br>Chihuahua, on the other hand, was small and loathsome. He was hardly a <br>dog, just all eyes and a wet little nose. P�p� should have had no admirers, <br>but he, like Basket, was a fine example of how my Mesdames" affections <br>were occasionally misplaced. Of course, my Mesdames asked me to <br>accompany them. Imagine them extending an invitation to Basket and P�p� <br>and not me. Never. We, remember, had been together for over half a decade <br>by then. I had traveled with them everywhere, though in truth that only <br>meant from Paris to their summer house in Bilignin. My Mesdames were <br>both in their fifties by the time I found them. They had lost their wanderlust by <br>then. A journey for them had come to mean an uneventful shuttle from one <br>site of comfort to another, an automobile ride through the muted colors of the <br>French countryside.<br> Ocean travel changed everything. My Mesdames began preparing <br>for it months in advance. They placed orders for new dresses, gloves, and <br>shoes. Nothing was extravagant, but everything was luxurious: waistcoats <br>embroidered with flowers and several kinds of birds, traveling outfits in <br>handsome tweeds with brown velvet trims and buttons, shoes identical <br>except for the heels and the size. The larger pair made only a slight effort at <br>a lift. They were schoolgirlish in their elevation but mannish in their <br>proportion. The smaller pair aspired to greater but hardly dizzying heights. <br>Both my Mesdames, remember, were very concerned about comfort.<br> "We"ll take a train from Paris to Le Havre, where the SS <br>Champlain will be docked. From there, the Atlantic will be our host for six to <br>seven days, and then New York City will float into view. From New York, <br>we"ll head north to Massachusetts, then south to Maryland and Virginia, then <br>west to Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Texas, California, all the way to the shores of <br>the Pacific and then, maybe, back again." As my Mesdames mapped the <br>proposed journey, the name of each city&#x2014;New York, Boston, Baltimore, <br>Cleveland, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco&#x2014;was a sharp note of <br>excitement rising from their otherwise atonal flats. Their voices especially <br>quivered at the mention of the airplanes. They wanted to see their America <br>from a true twentieth-century point of view, they told the photographers. <br>Imagine, they said to each other, a flight of fancy was no longer just a figure <br>of speech. They wondered about the cost of acquiring one for their very <br>own, a secondhand plane of course. My Mesdames were still practical, after <br>all.<br> I was somewhat superstitious. I thought that fate must have also <br>been listening in on this reverie about travel and flight. How could I not when <br>the letter arrived at the rue de Fleurus later on that same day? It was quite <br>an event. My Mesdames handed me the envelope on a small silver tray. They <br>said that they had been startled to realize that they had never seen my full <br>name in writing before. What probably startled them more was the <br>realization that during my years in their employment I had never received a <br>piece of correspondence until this one. I did not have to look at the envelope <br>to know. It was from my oldest brother. No one else back there would have <br>known where to find me, that 27 rue de Fleurus was my home. I sniffed the <br>envelope before opening it. It smelled of a faraway city, pungent with <br>anticipation for rain. If my Mesdames had not been in the room, I would have <br>tasted it with my tongue. I was certain to find the familiar sting of salt, but <br>what I needed to know was what kind: kitchen, sweat, tears or the sea. I <br>wanted this paper-shrouded thing to divulge itself to me, to tell me even <br>before the words emerged why it had taken my brother almost five years to <br>respond to my first and only letter home.<br> I had written to him at the end of 1929. I was drunk, sitting alone <br>in a crowded caf�. That December was a terrible month to be in Paris. All <br>my favorite establishments were either overly crowded or pathetically empty. <br>People either sipped fine vintages in celebration or gulped intoxicants of <br>who cares what kind, drowning themselves in a lack of moderation, raising a <br>glass to lower inhibitions, imbibing spirits to raise their own. The expressions <br>abounded, but that December the talk everywhere was the same: "The <br>Americans are going home." Better yet, those who had not were no longer <br>so cocky, so overweening with pride. Money, everyone was saying, is <br>required to keep such things alive. It was true, the Americans were going <br>home, and that, depending on who you were, was a cause to rejoice or a <br>cause to mourn.<br> The city"s le mont-de-pi�t�, for instance, were doing a booming <br>business. "Mountains of mercy," indeed. So French, so snide to use such a <br>heaping load of poetic words to refer to pawnshops, places filled with <br>everything of value but never with poetry. The pawnshops in Paris were <br>swamped, I had heard, with well-made American suits. At the end of <br>October when it all began, there were seersuckers, cotton broadcloths, <br>linens. Hardly a sacrifice at that time of the year, I thought. Paris was already <br>too cool for such garb. I have always thought it best to pawn my lightweight <br>suits when the weather changed. It provided protection from hungry moths <br>and a saving on mothballs. My own hunger also played a somewhat deciding <br>role. But by the beginning of that winter it became clear. The Americans were <br>pawning corduroys, three-ply wools, flannel-lined tweeds. Seasonal clothing <br>could only mean one thing. Desperation was demanding more closet space. <br>Desperation was extending its stay. The end of 1929 also brought with it <br>frustration, heard in and around all the caf�s, about the months" worth of <br>unpaid bar tabs, not to mention the skipped-out hotel bills or the overdue <br>rents. "The funds from home never made it across the Atlantic," the <br>departing Americans had claimed. The funds from home were never sent or, <br>worse, no longer enough, everyone in Paris by then knew. Americans, not <br>just here but in America, had lost their fortunes. An evil little wish had come <br>true. The Parisians missed the money all right, but no one missed the <br>Americans. Though I heard that in the beginning there had been sympathy. <br>When the Americans first began arriving, the Parisians had even felt <br>charitable toward them. These lost souls, after all, had taken flight from a <br>country where a bottle of wine was of all things contraband, a flute of <br>champagne a criminal offense. But when it became clear that the Americans <br>had no intention of leaving and no intention of ever becoming sober, the <br>Parisians wanted their city back. But it was already too late. The pattern of <br>behavior had become comically clear. Americans traveled here in order to <br>indulge in the "vices" of home. First, they had invaded the bordellos and then <br>it was the caf�s. Parisians could more than understand the whoring and the <br>drinking, but in the end it was the hypocrisy that did not translate well.<br> "But there are still the Russians, Hungarians, Spaniards . . . not <br>nearly as well endowed but in other ways so charmingly equipped." The <br>laughter that immediately followed this observation told me that the table <br>next to mine was commenting on more than just money. When gathered in <br>their caf�s, Parisians rarely spoke of money for very long. They exhausted <br>the topic with one or two words. Sex, though, was an entirely different story, <br>an epic really. I always got my gossip and my world news for that matter <br>from the caf�s. It would certainly take me awhile, but the longer I stayed the <br>more I was able to comprehend. Alcohol, I had learned, was an eloquent if <br>somewhat inaccurate interpreter. I had placed my trust that December night <br>in glass after glass of it, eager not for drink but for a bit of talk. I also had <br>that night no other place I had to be, so I sat and stared at the cigarette-<br>stained walls of the caf� until my wallet was empty, my bladder was full, and <br>until I was very drunk. Worse, the alcohol had deceived me, made me <br>promises and then refused to follow through. In the past the little glasses had <br>blurred the jagged seams between the French words, but that night they <br>magnified and sharpened them. They threatened to rip and to tear. They <br>bullied me with questions, sneering at how I could sit there stealing laughter, <br>lifting conversations, when it was now common knowledge that "the <br>Americans are going home." Panic then abruptly took over the line of <br>questioning: "Would my new Mesdames go with them?" Or, maybe, the <br>question was just a matter of "When?"<br> I did not remember asking the waiter for pencil and paper, but I <br>must have, as I never carry such items in my pockets. The caf�s used to <br>give them out for free. So French to sell water and to give such luxuries <br>away. The content of my letter was dull, crammed with details only my oldest <br>brother would be interested in: my health, the cost of underwear and shoes, <br>the price of a m�tro ticket, my weekly wage, the menu of my last meal, rain <br>bouncing off the face of Notre-Dame, Paris covered by a thin sheet of snow. I <br>had forgotten how different my language looks on paper, that its letters have <br>so little resemblance to how they actually sound. Words, most I had not <br>spoken for years, generously gave themselves to me. Fluency, after all, is <br>relative. On that sheet of paper, on another side of the globe, I am fluen...</p><h2>Research Methods in the Social Sciences w/Data Bank CD</h2><p>This acclaimed text offers a comprehensive, systematic treatment of the scientific approach to research within the context of the social sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It leads students through seven major, interrelated stages of research methods: definition of the research problem, statement of hypothesis, research design, measurement, data collection, data analysis, and generalization.The new edition features a new Data Bank CD and an appendix introducing students to SPSS.</p><p>Chava Frankfort-Nachmias is an Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, USA David Nachmias is a Senior Fellow Emeritus at the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) and holds the Romulo Betancourt Chair in Political Science at Tel Aviv University, Israel.</p><h2>Chemistry Problem Solver (Problem Solvers Solution Guides)</h2><p>Each Problem Solver is an insightful and essential study and solution guide chock-full of clear, concise problem-solving gems.

She offers complete, up-to-date information on the latest gear and techniques and detaile, hard-earned advice from dozens of experienced sailors, about boats, crew, and costs as well as crucial but easily overlooked aspects of long-distance passagemaking such as health, safety, weather, provisions, fresh water, and foreign port protocol. </p><p>With a balanced, down-to-earth approach, <i>The Voyager's Handbook</i> tells it like it is, for any cruiser considering that voyage of a lifetime.</p></p><p><p>"When other boats scurry back to their berths just ahead of the setting sun you want to keep sailing. You want your tracks to be the only ones on a perfect sand beach of a deserted tropical island. You want to see the green flahs, taste coconut milk from the husk, watch the fish dance at dusk, and share a feast with new friends from other cultures. Perhaps you have cruised for a few months along one of the coasts, for a season in the Caribbean, or for a year in the Atlantic. You probably returned relaxed and contented--full of plans for someday. This book can help you get there. It is written for coastal and limited offshore cruisers who want to make the transition to long-term voyaging.

Now, in late afternoon, the wind suddenly drops. The air becomes oppressively still.<br><br>There is silence, and a feeling of foreboding.<br><br>The sky turns ugly, shades of purple or green. In the distance, a faint, lacy whirl of dust spins across the ground.<br><br>A tornado is forming.<br><br>Now a gray condensation funnel appears from the clouds above. It descends tentatively toward the ground, a fragile ropelike finger.<br><br>Stretching downward, in silence.<br><br>As it touches the ground, the funnel begins to rotate faster. There is a deep rumbling sound, like the roar of an enormous freight train, as the tornado moves over the land, churning dust and debris at its base.<br><br>What happens next, no one can predict.<br><br>Most tornadoes lose power within a few minutes, the funnel shrinking and tilting forward, roping out--vanishing as quickly as they have come.<br><br>But at other times, the tornado on the ground grows steadily in strength and roaring power. The base widens from a hundred yards to a diameter of half a mile or more. Winds reach 300 miles an hour. Such huge tornadoes may stay on the ground for an hour, leaving behind a path of devastation a hundred miles long, before they, too, finally dissipate and disappear back into the sky.<br><br>What makes one tornado last for a few seconds, and another last for an hour, causing death and destruction? No one really knows. Scientists have made complex computer models, laboratory simulations, and observations on the ground. <br><br>But still, even today, no one really knows.<br>The United States has more tornadoes than any nation on Earth. Although tornadoes occur everywhere on our planet, the geography of the U.S. is uniquely suited for tornado formation. Each spring, cold, dry air coming down from Canada meets war, wet air flowing up from the Gulf of Mexico. These weather fronts meet over the broad, flat prairies of the central United States, producing enormous thunderclouds of great beauty and power. Some of these thunderclouds--perhaps one in a thousand--will produce tornadoes.<br><br>In Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, tornadoes occur so commonly that the area has long been known as "Tornado Alley." The frequency of tornadoes in the central states has made this the ideal place for scientists to observe tornado formation. Each spring, a group of scientists known as storm chasers travel up and down this region, searching for tornadoes and studying them in a variety of ways.<br><br>These storm chasers are unusual people. They combine the rigor of hard scientists with the instincts of naturalists and hunters. Their season is short, only a few months each year. Their work is fast-paced and sometimes dangerous, for they are studying the most unpredictable--and potentially deadly--phenomena of nature. Above all, they must be patient, for in a good year, they will witness two, or perhaps three, tornadoes. In a bad year, they will see none at all.<br><br>More than a thousand tornadoes touch down in the United States every year, but most are fleeting, lasting only a few minutes. Many occur at night, or in remote regions, and they are never seen by anyone at all. Historically, the elusive nature of tornadoes has meant that they have rarely been filmed. Most newsreel footage showed the aftermath, the shattered towns and destroyed farmhouses, long after the tornado itself had vanished. In fact, prior to 1965, only two tornadoes were ever recorded by movie cameras. Tornadoes might be mysterious and feared, but they were also largely unseen. Eyewitness accounts of their behavior were wild, and wildly conflicting.<br><br>All that changed with the advent of home video cameras. By the late 1980s, these cameras were common in households across the country, and soon, literally hundreds of home videos began to record tornadoes of all sorts. From this wealth of new visual information came new scientific understanding. The behavior of tornadoes began to be much better understood, at least descriptively. For example, tornadoes were recognized to have a distinct life cycle, marked by distinct visual stages.<br><br>At the same time, the scientific approach to tornadoes became more sophisticated. A nationwide system of Doppler radar gave storm chasers much better information about where a tornado was likely to occur. And the chasers themselves employed more advanced techniques, portable Doppler radars, particle photogrammetry, and even, in the case of pioneer Howard Bluestein, a special instrument pack called TOTO (for Totable Tornado Observatory), which was intended to be carried on the back of a truck, placed in the path of the tornado, and taken up inside the funnel.<br><br>The work of the storm chasers and the visual drama of the tornadoes themselves had long interested my wife, Anne-Marie Martin, who from time to time would announce that somebody should make a movie on the subject. My answer was always the same: It's a good subject, but what's the story? In late 1993, she argued for a very simple structure, a romantic triangle set against the background of a race to place an instrument pack in a tornado. She felt the tension of chasing tornadoes would lead people to behave in an exaggerated fashion--to say things they wouldn't ordinarily say, and do things they wouldn't ordinarily do. She proposed a short, intense time-course for the story, no more than a day or two. And she argued for a lot of scientific dialogue which would carry undercurrents of personal meaning behind the technical surface. I was doubtful about this, because I had tried exactly that procedure in a script called "ER," and so far, no one had made it.<br><br>Nevertheless, her idea took hold. From the beginning, the subject seemed to me inherently visual, and therefore should be a script, not a book. Tornadoes are an ideal film subject, because unlike most meteorological phenomena, they are small enough to fit within the film frame, and they last a short time, changing rapidly. By comparison, a hurricane is hundreds of miles across, too big to see in a single image, and it goes on for hours, with little change. Tornadoes are much more contained, and visually compelling.<br><br>We were further encouraged by early research that showed the premise was valid. Not only had real scientists attempted to put instrument packs into funnels, but there had been many recorded episodes when so-called outbreaks of tornadoes occurred--as many as a hundred tornadoes touching down in a single day, often only a few minutes apart. That was what we required for our story, and it did indeed happen. It wasn't even rare: outbreaks of forty or more tornadoes had occurred seven times in the past ten years. The worst recorded outbreak, according to Ted Fujita, had taken place in April 1974, when 148 tornadoes touched down in a day, producing 2,400 miles of damage path.<br><br>So it seemed as if the story was possible. Eventually, with some trepidation, we decided to write the script together, and we began in January 1994. It was not clear to either of us how this would work out, or whether it would work at all. We had plenty of advice that collaboration was a good way to end a marriage. But, as it turned out, we had an easy time working together; the structure was unusually clear, dictating what should happen next. And, invariably, we drew our episodes and details from actual recorded events, making up nothing. This was important because tornadoes are so inherently dramatic, it is easy to become excessive in the usual Hollywood manner, and we wanted the incidents to remain true to underlying reality.<br><br>That reality was always worrisome. Because what we didn't know, during the spring and summer of 1994, was whether it would be possible to film the sequences we were so cheerfully writing. We were relying on computer graphics to accomplish this, but it is far more difficult to make a tornado in a computer than a dinosaur. On the other hand, George Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic is one of the most continuously successful R&amp;D operations in American history. Thus, we blithely assumed that ILM's rapid advances in computer graphics would continue, so that by the time we were finished writing, it would be possible to simulate tornadic motion onscreen. And that turned out to be true. We saw a film test in January 1995 that was chilling in its verisimilitude.<br><br>As is so often the case with big Hollywood movies, other hands took over the project, and moved it off in other directions. What audiences will see includes the work of many other, uncredited writers, but readers may be interested to see how the project appeared at an earlier time.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the real world, Howard Bluestein and other researchers had long since abandoned their attempts to place an instrument pack in a tornado funnel. They tried for five seasons, and never succeeded--although they did determine that TOTO was too light, and too easy to tip over in tornadic wings. But we have the greatest admiration for the tenacity and daring of the real storm chasers, and, as we wrote this screenplay, we hoped that they would be amused to find that in the movies, at least, their attempts met with success.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Guinness World Records 2014</h2><p>Guinness World Records 2014 brings together thousands of the planet's most awe-inspiring people, pets and products, including new record-holders such as a skateboarding goat, a 15-meter-long robot dragon, the world's furriest cat and a king-size drumkit that needs five people to play it!<br><br>Packed to bursting with new and updated achievements, Guinness World Records 2014 features an all-new design and more images than we've ever had before - including over 100 all-new original photographs you won't find anywhere else.

He is the author of two non-fiction books, The Geography of Nowhere and Home From Nowhere, and nine novels. He has been a regular contributor to the New York Times Sunday Magazine and Op-Ed page, where he has written on environmental and economic issues. The Long Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-first Century was published in 2005.It used to be that only environmentalists and paranoids warned about the world running out of oil and the future it could bring: crashing economies, resource wars, social breakdown, agony at the pump. Not anymore. . . . America&#x2019;s dependence on oil is too pervasive to undo quickly, [Kunstler] warns. . . . In the meantime, we&#x2019;ll have our hands full dealing with . . . the soaring temperatures, rising sea levels and mega-droughts brought by global climate change.

But scientists have long cautioned against such anthropomorphizing, arguing that it limits our ability to truly comprehend the lives of other creatures. Recently, however, things have begun to shift in the other direction, and anthropologist Barbara J. King is at the forefront of that movement, arguing strenuously that we can&#x2014;and <i>should</i>&#x2014;attend to animal emotions. With <i>How Animals Grieve</i>, she draws our attention to the specific case of grief, and relates story after story&#x2014;from fieldsites, farms, homes, and more&#x2014;of animals mourning lost companions, mates, or friends.&nbsp;King tells of elephants surrounding their matriarch as she weakens and dies, and, in the following days, attending to her corpse as if holding a vigil. A housecat loses her sister, from whom she's never before been parted, and spends weeks pacing the apartment, wailing plaintively. A baboon loses her daughter to a predator and sinks into grief. In each case, King uses her anthropological training to interpret and try to explain what we see&#x2014;to help us understand this animal grief properly, as something neither the same as nor wholly different from the human experience of loss. &nbsp;The resulting book is both daring and down-to-earth, strikingly ambitious even as it&#x2019;s careful to acknowledge the limits of our understanding. Through the moving stories she chronicles and analyzes so beautifully, King brings us closer to the animals with whom we share a planet, and helps us see our own experiences, attachments, and emotions as part of a larger web of life, death, love, and loss. <br></p><p><b>Barbara J. King</b> is professor of anthropology at the College of William and Mary. She is the author or editor of many books, including <i>Being with Animals</i>. She blogs regularly for National Public Radio and reviews for the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.<br>"A beautifully written book that will appeal to animal lovers." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Barbara J. King has pulled together anecdotal and scientific data on grief and love in animals in her excellent book <i>How Animals Grieve</i>. With her engaging story telling she opens up our eyes to the possible inner lives of some surprising species. We expect big-brained chimpanzees and elephants to express their feelings, but her tales of rabbits, goats, birds, turtles and others force us to look again at the emotional content of animal lives.&#x201d; (Cynthia Moss, author of Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Ele)<br><br>&#x201c;Poignant, thoughtful, and sometimes heartbreaking. King once again elevates the discussion of animal emotion. She tackles a tricky subject with a scientist's care and an animal lover's grace.&#x201d;<br> (Jennifer Holland, author of Unlikely Friendships)<br><br>"I must admit that I was skeptical that an entire book could be written on the subject of animal grief, because the scientific literature in this area is so painfully thin. But Barbara King has succeeded beautifully. She has collected an incredible database of stories about various kinds of animals, and taken together they offer more than enough substance to sustain this book. It is as if she has created a mosaic for her reader. She has collected bits and pieces--individual stories about one animal or another--which by themselves might be little but trifles. But King pastes them together with masterful skill, and the result is a compelling picture of animal grief. We get the feeling that there are still a lot of blank spaces on the canvas, as our scientific understanding is far from complete, but it is only a matter of time before these spaces will begin to fill in. <i>How Animals Grieve</i>&nbsp;is a fascinating book which will interest and inform animal lovers and scientists alike." (Jessica Pierce, author of The Last Walk)<br><br><p>"In this deeply moving and beautifully composed treatise that is sure to anger some, but inspire many, Barbara King methodically presents her powerful evidence that many animals possess thoughts, feelings and emotions, including the profound sense of loss following the death of a family member or close companion. Consider, for example, the female dolphin who carries her dead calf for several days, loath to part with her beloved child. What else is she doing but grieving? It might be a controversial, minority viewpoint that some animals mourn the death of others, but King's profound and well-documented work has left me firmly in her camp."</p><p></p> (David Kirby, author of Death at Sea World)<br><br><p>"Humans and other animals experience love and fear, and form deep emotional bonds with cherished companions. We mourn when a close friend dies, and so do other animals, as Barbara King's poignant book illustrates in compelling detail. <i>How Animals Grieve</i> helps us to connect and to better understand the complex social lives of other animals and of ourselves."</p> (Gene Baur, president and cofounder of Farm Sanctuary)<br><br>"Let me begin by saying I recommend this book to anyone who doubts that animals grieve. The evidence presented is overwhelming." (<i>EcoLit</i>)<br><br><i>"How Animals Grieve</i> is not the definitive work on animal grief, but rather a stepping-stone to further investigation, observation and understanding. King hopes others will continue to look with fresh eyes, expand our knowledge and better understand all animals."

The election of 1800 was a thunderous clash of a campaign that climaxed in a deadlock in the Electoral College and led to a crisis in which the young republic teetered on the edge of collapse.<br><br><em>Adams vs. Jefferson</em> is the gripping account of a turning point in American history, a dramatic struggle between two parties with profoundly different visions of how the nation should be governed. The Federalists, led by Adams, were conservatives who favored a strong central government. The Republicans, led by Jefferson, were more egalitarian and believed that the Federalists had betrayed the Revolution of 1776 and were backsliding toward monarchy. The campaign itself was a barroom brawl every bit as ruthless as any modern contest, with mud-slinging, scare tactics, and backstabbing. The low point came when Alexander Hamilton printed a devastating attack on Adams, the head of his own party, in "fifty-four pages of unremitting vilification." The stalemate in the Electoral College dragged on through dozens of ballots. Tensions ran so high that the Republicans threatened civil war if the Federalists denied Jefferson the presidency. Finally a secret deal that changed a single vote gave Jefferson the White House. A devastated Adams left Washington before dawn on Inauguration Day, too embittered even to shake his rival's hand.<br><br>With magisterial command, Ferling brings to life both the outsize personalities and the hotly contested political questions at stake. He shows not just why this moment was a milestone in U.S. history, but how strongly the issues--and the passions--of 1800 resonate with our own time.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Ferling</strong> is Professor of History at the State University of West Georgia. A leading authority on American Revolutionary history, he has appeared in many documentaries and has written numerous books, including <em>John Adams: A Life, The First of Men: A Life of George Washington, Setting the World</em> <em>Ablaze: Washington, Adams, and Jefferson in the American Revolution</em>, and the award-winning <em>A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic</em>.<br><br>"Ferling at his best. It would be hard to find a better guide to the complexities of this very complex election, and Ferling is particularly good at showing just how many contingencies there were....Useful and lucid."--Herbert Sloan, <em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Ferling richly presents the twists and turns of the election, as well as a vivid portrait of a struggling new nation and the bruising political battles of our now revered founding fathers, including the major roles played by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton....Ferling's ultimate triumph is showing that, historically, when faced with dire circumstances at home and abroad, American democracy has pulled through."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"This is a stunning book, by far the finest ever on one of the most critical elections in the nation's history. If you thought 2000 was wild, wait until you read John Ferling's vivid and authoritative account of 1800. A brilliant historian and graceful stylist, Ferling topples old and new myths, and restores Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton to their proper places, while sustaining a lucid and gripping narrative. There is no better concise work on high political drama in the early republic--and on the tortuous and contested emergence of American democracy."--Sean Wilentz, Princeton University<p></p><br>"The tale of Adams and Jefferson is a painful and moving one. They were friends, then enemies, then friends again over a period of more than 50 years. Ferling does a good job of summing up the similarities that made their friendship possible as well as the differences destined to drive them apart."--<em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Ferling is especially adept at revealing the bare-knuckled partisanship that lay behind this vote, and the maneuvering between Burr and Federalists in the House of Representatives that might have made Burr president rather than Jefferson."--<em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"The 2004 campaign may seem tame after historian Ferling's riveting account of the 1800 presidential race."--<em>USA Today</em><p></p><br>"A well-written look at the enigmatic politics and personalities of the early Republic."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"A lively and reliable account of Thomas Jefferson's election as President in 1800, a fiery period in American history. Readers who assume that national politics in the 1990s was the dirtiest ever or that the election of 2000 was the most controversial will be struck to learn that political rivalries in the 1790s were even dirtier....General readers will find it exciting, clear, and instructive."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Ferling's straightforward narrative makes complicated history accessible to the average reader. He writes with authority, and his storyteller's touch makes many of these figures come alive."--<em>Wilmington News-Journal</em><p></p><br>"Guiding his reader through the critical time he calls the 'high voltage' 1790s, John Ferling makes sense of the crisis mentality that enveloped early America. From the 'narrow Squeak' that awarded John Adams the presidency in 1796 to 'something new under the sun' that spirited Thomas Jefferson into office four years later, Ferling lays out a tempting tale of political life, once again proving himself a careful, clear-headed interpreter of issues and personalities."--Andrew Burstein, University of Tulsa, author of <em>The Inner Jefferson</em> and <em>The Passions of Andrew Jackson</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Adams vs. Jefferson</em>, the distinguished historian John Ferling offers a fascinating narrative of the election of 1800 and demonstrates how that dramatic contest could have doomed the American experiment in republicanism. Instead, the election, a far more contentious event than the election of 2000, marked the true consolidation of the American Revolution and the triumph of the ideal of government resting on the consent of the governed."--John K.

In their sharing of the term, both kinds of clouds reveal an essential truth: that the natural world and the technological world are not so distinct. In <i>The Marvelous Clouds</i>, John Durham Peters argues that though we often think of media as environments, the reverse is just as true&#x2014;environments <i>are</i> media.<br> <br> Peters defines media expansively as elements that compose the human world. Drawing from ideas implicit in media philosophy, Peters argues that media are more than carriers of messages: they are the very infrastructures combining nature and culture that allow human life to thrive. Through an encyclopedic array of examples from the oceans to the skies, <i>The Marvelous Clouds</i> reveals the long prehistory of so-called new media. Digital media, Peters argues, are an extension of early practices tied to the establishment of civilization such as mastering fire, building calendars, reading the stars, creating language, and establishing religions. New media do not take us into uncharted waters, but rather confront us with the deepest and oldest questions of society and ecology: how to manage the relations people have with themselves, others, and the natural world.<br> <br> A wide-ranging meditation on the many means we have employed to cope with the struggles of existence&#x2014;from navigation to farming, meteorology to Google&#x2014;<i>The Marvelous Clouds</i> shows how media lie at the very heart of our interactions with the world around us. Peters&#x2019;s book will not only change how we think about media but provide a new appreciation for the day-to-day foundations of life on earth that we so often take for granted.</p></p><p><b>John Durham Peters </b>is the A.

When Melville set the <i>Pequod</i> sailing between heaven and earth, he turned the ship into a lens through which his readers could examine humankind&#x2019;s place in the cosmos. In <i>The Marvelous Clouds</i>, Peters turns water, land, fire, and sky into lenses through which readers can explore the role of mediation in every aspect of their lives. This is a completely original, wildly ambitious, and deliciously lyrical book. It will certainly change the way you see media. It might also change the way you see the world.&#x201d; (Fred Turner, author of The Democratic Surround: Multimedia and American Liberalism from World War II to the Psychedelic Sixties)<br><br>&#x201c;Wide-ranging, playful, erudite, and delightfully diverse, <i>The Marvelous Clouds </i>redefines media in the largest possible terms, as anything that communicates meaning, including bodies, the environment, and the world itself.&nbsp; Although this may seem to rob media of its specificity and therefore of its theoretical purchase, in Peters&#x2019;s hands it becomes the occasion for making surprising and insightful connections.&nbsp; A treat for academics and general readers alike, this is a book not to be missed.&#x201d; (N. Katherine Hayles, author of How We Think: Digital Media and Contemporary Technogenesis)<br><br>&#x201c;Peters&#x2019;s dazzlingly intelligent and elegantly written book has the potential of marking a long-anticipated threshold in the world of media studies. Conversant with the philosophical traditions and with the ongoing debates in Germany, where this emerging discipline took its origin, his epistemological realism overcomes the conventional positions of the &#x2018;linguistic turn&#x2019; and of &#x2018;constructivism&#x2019; with a fresh and truly inspired unfolding of intuitions ranging from Martin Heidegger's &#x2018;fourfold&#x2019; to the Emersonian philosophy of nature. Between earth and sky, Peters understands and analyzes media as the energy behind our environment&#x2019;s permanent transformations. <i>The Marvelous Clouds</i>, I believe, is the foundational media epistemology that we have been awaiting for decades.&#x201d; (Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, author of Atmosphere, Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature)<br><br>&#x201c;The book is, on one level, an ambitious re-writing &#x2014; a re-synthesis, even &#x2014; of concepts of media and culture. On another, it is a rich and entertaining compendium of arcana, covering everything from shipwrighting to planetary motion, from bone evolution to calendrical design. Ultimately, it is nothing less than an attempt at a history of Being, from an unusually brisk, cheerful and pragmatic Heideggerian.&#x201d; (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A highly original book. . . . This is a deeply philosophical and beautifully written account of the modes of being of all things, and their interrelationships.&#x201d; (<i>Independent (UK)</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;More than fundamental. Media in this book are not defined as just more technological supplements to human beings but as a source that opens an extension for human self-knowledge. . . . Peters defines modern technologies as a space endowed with intelligence that seeks to be like God.&#x201d; (Dmytro Drozdovskyi, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine)<br><br>&#x201c;With great accessibility, Peters presents an overview of media philosophy since the mid-20th century. Figures notorious for their opaque philosophical ruminations, such as Martin Heidegger and Marshall McLuhan, are introduced with an inviting blend of humor and clarity. Throughout his thorough discussions of contemporary German media theory, Peters blends in unexpected liter�ary allusions and offers comparisons to American think�ers such as Thoreau or Emerson. Peters&#x2019; ability to turn a good phrase is welcome.&#x201d;<br> (<i>ArtPapers</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Working from the belief that there is meaning in nature, Peters posits that media are environmental. He philosophizes beyond the divides and creates a conversation between the material and the immaterial to navigate the digital landscape. In seven chapters, Peters sketches the landscape of media theory by examining media via the metaphors of sea, fire, sky, Earth, and the ethereal. In a particularly interesting chapter, &#x2018;God and Google,&#x2019; Peters explores the &#x2018;right to be forgotten&#x2019;&#x2014;the right to have old and unflattering data wiped from the Web. In the conclusion, he argues that the public sphere has always needed nature as its condition, but now the public sphere needs content as well. Other fine books have engaged the topic of digital media . . . but until now, none offered a philosophical exploration of media's place at the very heart of human interactions with the world.

With scenes of sexual warfare that rival the devastation of its battlefield scenes, <i>Parade's End</i> is a profound dramatization of one man's internal struggles during a time of brutal world conflict. The culminating achievement of Ford's career, it fulfills his ambitious conception of the novelist's role as the historian of the present, capturing the essence of the age.</p></p><p>by Malcolm Bradbury<p><b>Ford Madox Ford</b> was born Ford Hermann Hueffer in England in 1873. In 1919 he changed his name to Ford Madox Ford in honour of his grandfather, the Pre-Raphaelite painter Ford Madox Brown, whose biography he had written. Ford was well-known for both his fiction and his criticism. He founded two influential journals, <i>The English Review</i> in 1908 and <i>The Transatlantic Review</i> in 1924, in which he championed many of the leading modernist writers of the day. His most famous novels include the tetralogy <i>Parade&#x2019;s End </i>and <i>The Good Soldier, </i>which are still ranked among the greatest literary works of the twentieth century.

This introductory Companion, consisting of fourteen new introductory essays by scholars of international standing, provides individual studies of Donne, Jonson, Herrick, Herbert, Carew, Suckling, Lovelace, Milton, Crashaw, Vaughan and Marvell, together with general essays on the political, social and religious context, and the relationship of poetry to the mutations and developments of genre and tradition.</p><p>Fourteen essays provide individual studies of Donne, Jonson, Herrick, Herbert, Carew, Suckling, Lovelace, Milton, Crashaw, Vaughan and Marvell.

Choice<br><br>"Although each of the essays is self-contained and written without reference to others in the collection, they form, when read together, a very satisfying whole. The sophisticated level of the critical discourse of the essays, as well as the authoritative scholarship that informs them, goes well beyond one's usual expectations for such collections." John R. Roberts, Seventeenth-Century News<br><br>"...one of the signal virtues of this fine collection is its expert blend of traditional and novel approaches. The entire collection attests at once to the interpretive power of a currently unfashionable mode of criticism that pays attention to genre and provides cogency to the current emphasis on the material transmission of books and manuscripts. One emerges from the collection not with the sense of the enormous distance separating new and old approaches but rather with a refreshing picture of the contiguity of new and old....A fine introduction to the field for ambitious undergraduates and beginning graduate students, it contains more than enough novelty to sustain the interest of specialists."

Under Miss Bunting&#39;s tutelage, Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Fielding, renews an old school acquaintance with the daughter of Hogglestock&#39;s successful, albeit not genteel, iron master. We must move with the times, says the unflappable governess when Lady Fielding questions the suitability of this association. With characteristics aplomb, Miss Bunting takes girls and situation both firmly in hand and sets all things to right.</p><p>Angela Thirkell, granddaughter of pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones, was born in London in 1890. Related to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, cousin to Rudyard Kipling, mother of Colin Maclnnes and Graham Mclnnes, Thirkell was one of the most famous comic novelists of her day. She died in 1961 just before her seventy-first birthday.From the '30s to the '60s, Thirkell wrote a novel a year, most of which were set in an updated version of Trollope's Barsetshire. This installment, originally published in 1945 is a mild and rather obvious comedy of manners set during one summer late in WWII, when traditional order is being brought to an end by the rise of industrial wealth and the damages inflicted by six years of war. The story revolves around a wide group of the upper class--primarily landowners and clergymen--who have dominated this small town, and how they will respond to arrival of a coarse but dynamic industrial tycoon. Miss Bunting is an elderly ex-governess who has been hired by one family to instruct and care for their 17-year-old daughter, Anne. This gentle comedy radiates out to encompass fictitious, "Mixo-Lydian" politics; the even more complicated goings-on of the C. of E.; and the entirely inscrutable underpinnings of British class structure. There are numerous characters, some dashing in and out of the narrative with such speed that the only thing they contribute is the memory of a vaguely humorous name. Some will find the book dated, but for Thirkell's many readers in this country, it will be a welcome addition to the growing library of her work. <p></p><p>Copyright 1996 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>This Radical Land: A Natural History of American Dissent</h2><p><b>One of <i>The Guardian</i>'s Best Books of 2018</b><b>A <i>Lit Hub</i> Favorite Book of 2018</b><b>An <i>EcoLit Books</i> Best Environmental Book of 2018</b><b></b><br>"The American people sees itself advance across the wilderness, draining swamps, straightening rivers, peopling the solitude, and subduing nature," wrote Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835. That's largely how we still think of nineteenth-century America today: a country expanding unstoppably, bending the continent's natural bounty to the national will, heedless of consequence. A country of slavery and of Indian wars. There's much truth in that vision.&nbsp;But if you know where to look, you can uncover a different history, one of vibrant resistance, one that's been mostly forgotten. This Radical Land recovers that story. Daegan Miller is our guide on a beautifully written, revelatory trip across the continent during which we encounter radical thinkers, settlers, and artists who grounded their ideas of freedom, justice, and progress in the very landscapes around them, even as the runaway engine of capitalism sought to steamroll everything in its path. Here we meet Thoreau, the expert surveyor, drawing anticapitalist property maps. We visit a black antislavery community in the Adirondack wilderness of upstate New York. We discover how seemingly commercial photographs of the transcontinental railroad secretly sent subversive messages, and how a band of utopian anarchists among California's sequoias imagined a greener, freer future. At every turn, everyday radicals looked to landscape for the language of their dissent--drawing crucial early links between the environment and social justice, links we're still struggling to strengthen today.&nbsp;Working in a tradition that stretches from Thoreau to Rebecca Solnit, Miller offers nothing less than a new way of seeing the American past--and of understanding what it can offer us for the present . . . and the future.</p><p>Daegan Miller has taught at Cornell University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his writing has appeared in a variety of venues, from academic journals to literary magazines. He is on Twitter at @daeganmiller."Through interpretive brilliance and gorgeously crafted prose, Daegan Miller's <i>This Radical Land: A Natural History of Dissent</i> rescues this sense of environmental awe from excessive skepticism....One of the most elegant and insightful examples of environmental writing I've seen in many, many years." (James McWilliams, <i>Pacific Standard</i>)<br><br>"Nuanced, provocative and immensely learned." (<i>Nature, Plants</i>)<br><br>"Miller's study is not just a historical counternarrative, then: It's also a way of thinking about the contradictions of modern environmentalism, of asking whom the movement serves, what ideas are allowed, and who is marginalized." (<i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>"Miller's debut views landscape...as both a witness to and a participant in American history, especially in stories of resistance.... The result is a text that succeeds not only in arguing its theories and presenting an elegant narrative but in reminding us just how easily certain people and places can be erased from our popular histories....Fans of Derrick Jensen, Howard Zinn, and Rebecca Solnit will appreciate Miller's fascinating and unexpected perspective on American history." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"A debut book that ranges across disciplines and decades to connect the natural environment--especially long-lived trees--to a scathing critique of American-style capitalism. Alternating abstract theory with impressive research, both bolstered by extensive sources . . . the author builds his case about understanding American history by examining destruction of the environment through essays grounded in the 19th century. . . . He offers an eclectic education often marked by soaring prose." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inventive. . . . A creative linking of landscape and radicalism." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drawing on superb scholarly detective work, This Radical Land tells fascinating stories about the history of our ties to the land that give us an alternative to viewing natural spaces as either a resource to exploit or a wilderness museum for the privileged. Miller peels back the history to reveal that, however ignored, Americans have always resisted the exploitation of nature. Perhaps his more nuanced environmental history will inspire those today who, continuing the mute protest of the witness tree, would pull the planet back from the brink of death." (Richard Higgins, author of <i>Thoreau and the Language of Trees</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daegan Miller rekindles a legacy of environmental dissent. The ideas and landscapes of nineteenth-century 'countermoderns' are signposts, still legible, to alternative futures. This book bears witness like a burning bush."(Jared Farmer, author of <i>Trees in Paradise: A California History</i>)</p><h2>Handbuch Zur Deutschen Grammatik</h2><p>The Arbeitsheft is divided into two sections: a workbook that focuses on writing, and a lab manual that develops listening comprehension.

The book critically examines distinctions between microevolution--which even religious Fundamentalists generally do not dispute--and the far more contentious macroevolution. Contributors also address the influence of evolution on philosophy, sociology, and religion and provide an excellent discussion of American antievolutionism and the ongoing controversy of teaching evolution versus intelligent design/creationism in schools.

Reproduced here are essays by six celebrated children's book authors that came into being as a series of talks at the New York Public Library in 1989. Children's book writing is often deceptively simple, and perhaps the one overriding theme here is the seriousness with which these writers approach their work. "Writing for very young children is the most difficult discipline I know," says Rosemary Wells, whose Max and Ruby books were the first board books. (Does Wells find it so difficult in part because, as she says, "all really good picture books are written to be read five hundred times"?) Poet Jack Prelutsky, inventor of the "gloopy gloppers" and the "addle-pated paddlepuss," says he never condescends when he write for children. And Maurice Sendak, best known for his fantastically fuzzy wild things, says he's "never spent less than two years on the text of one of my picture books, even though each of them is approximately 380 words long. Only when the text is finished ... do I begin the pictures." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i>William Zinsser is a writer, editior, and teacher. His fifteen books include the classic On Writing Well, which is in the sixth edition, and Writing to Learn. He lives in New York City.</p><h2>Finding Your Strength in Difficult Times : A Book of Meditations</h2><p>Meditations for finding inner renewal in times of distress through a heightened sense of self and the surrounding world.</p><p><p><i><b>I do not try to be accepted.</b></i><br> <i><b>I do not search for love.</b></i><br> <i><b>I want only to be me and am grateful</b></i><br> <i><b>for the gift of myself.</b></i></p> <p>The road of life is seldom a smooth one--it's dotted with potholes, treacherous turns, speed bumps, and numerous detours.

This concise but thorough text demonstrates that interest groups are involved in the political system at all levels of government &#x2013; federal, state, and local &#x2013; and in all aspects of political activity, from election campaigns to agenda setting to lawmaking to policy implementation. Rather than an anomaly or distortion of the political system, it is a normal and healthy function of a pluralist society and democratic governance. Nonetheless, Nownes warns of the dangers of unwatched interest group activity, especially in the realms of the electoral process and issue advocacy. </p> <p><em>Interest Groups in American Politics, </em>Second Edition, is grounded by the role of information in interest group activity, a theme that runs through the entire book. This much anticipated revision of Nownes&#x2019;s text retains a student friendly tone and thoroughly updates the references to interest group research, as well as adds a new chapter on the connections between interest groups and political parties. Numerous figures and tables throughout the book help students visualize important trends and information.</p></p><p><strong>Anthony J.

Ian Hacking here presents a philosophical critique of early ideas about probability, induction and statistical inference and the growth of this new family of ideas in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The contemporary debate centres round such figures as Pascal, Leibniz and Jacques Bernoulli. What brought about the change in ideas? The author invokes in his explanation a wider intellectual framework involving the growth of science, economics and the theology of the period.</p><p>A philosophical study of the early ideas about probability, induction and statistical inference, covering the period 1650-1705.'Ian Hacking's delightful new book is a tour de force of historical scholarship ... [He] takes us on a fascinating tour, not only among the 17th century giants of probability theory, such as Pascal, Huygens, Leibniz, and Bernoulli, but among their predecessors and descendants ... the book can be recommended to anyone interested in history, or philosophy, or gambling, or theology. It contributes to the understanding of all these topics and more.' Theory and Decision<br><br>'This is not a technical book on probability, although of course Hacking is at home in this field and writes easily about it when necessary. His book is an important contribution to the history of ideas, cutting new paths, joining some of the more standard and known aspects of the early history of probability theory with lesser-known but equally important works ... not only does Hacking write well, but he has a firm historical sense, and is careful to get the views he discusses correct. His history of the idea of probability is careful, accurate, and absolutely absorbing.'

Kraus&#x2019;s play enacts the tragic trajectory of the First World War, when mankind raced toward self-destruction by methods of modern warfare while extolling the glory and ignoring the horror of an allegedly &#x201c;defensive&#x201d; war. This volume is the first to present a complete English translation of Kraus&#x2019;s towering work, filling a major gap in the availability of Viennese literature from the era of the War to End All Wars.<br><br> Bertolt Brecht hailed <i>The Last Days</i> as the masterpiece of Viennese modernism. In the apocalyptic drama Kraus constructs a textual collage, blending actual quotations from the Austrian army&#x2019;s call to arms, people&#x2019;s responses, political speeches, newspaper editorials, and a range of other sources. Seasoning the drama with comic invention and satirical verse, Kraus reveals how bungled diplomacy, greedy profiteers, Big Business complicity, gullible newsreaders, and, above all, the sloganizing of the press brought down the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the dramatization of sensationalized news reports, inurement to atrocities, and openness to war as remedy, today&#x2019;s readers will hear the echo of the fateful voices Kraus recorded as his homeland descended into self-destruction.</p><p>The Austrian Jewish author <b>Karl Kraus</b> (1874&#x2013;1936) was the foremost German-language satirist of the twentieth century. As editor of the journal <i>Die Fackel (The Torch)</i> he conducted a sustained critique of propaganda and the press, expressed through polemical essays, witty aphorisms, and resonant poems. <b>Edward Timms</b>, founding director of the University of Sussex Centre for German-Jewish Studies, is best known for his two-volume study <i>Karl Kraus&#x2014;Apocalyptic Satirist</i>.

Because they were given to &#x201c;pioneers&#x201d; dedicated to opening a new Waldorf school, these talks are often considered one of the best introductions to Waldorf education. <br><br> Steiner shows the necessity for teachers to work on themselves first, in order to transform their own inherent gifts. He explains the need to use humor to keep their teaching lively and imaginative. Above all, he stresses the tremendous importance of doing everything in the knowledge that children are citizens of both the spiritual and the earthly worlds. And, throughout these lectures, he continually returns to the practical value of Waldorf education. <br><br> These talks are filled with practical illustrations and revolve around certain themes&#x2015;the need for observation in teachers; the dangers of stressing the intellect too early; children&#x2019;s need for teaching that is concrete and pictorial; the education of children&#x2019;s souls through wonder and reverence; the importance of first presenting the &#x201c;whole,&#x201d; then the parts, to the children&#x2019;s imagination. <br><br> Here is one of the best introductions to Waldorf education, straight from the man who started it all. <br><br> German source: <i>Die Kunst des Erziehens aus dem Erfassen der Menschenwesenhiet</i> (GA 311). <br><br> <b>SYNOPSIS OF THE LECTURES</b> <ul> <li> <b>LECTURE 1:</b> The need for a new art of education. The whole of life must be considered. Process of incarnation as a stupendous task of the spirit. Fundamental changes at seven and fourteen. At seven, the forming of the &#x201c;new body&#x201d; out of the &#x201c;model body&#x201d; inherited at birth. After birth, the bodily milk as sole nourishment. The teacher&#x2019;s task to give &#x201c;soul milk&#x201d; at the change of teeth and &#x201c;spiritual milk&#x201d; at puberty. </li><li> <b>LECTURE 2:</b> In first epoch of life child is wholly sense organ. Nature of child&#x2019;s environment and conduct of surrounding adults of paramount importance. Detailed observation of children and its significance. In second epoch, seven to fourteen, fantasy and imagination as life blood of all education, e.g., in teaching of writing and reading, based on free creative activity of each teacher. The child as integral part of the environment until nine. Teaching about nature must be based on this. The &#x201c;higher truths&#x201d; in fairy tales and myths. How the teacher can guide the child through the critical moment of the ninth year. </li><li> <b>LECTURE 3:</b> How to teach about plants and animals (seven to fourteen). Plants must always be considered, not as specimens, but growing in the soil. The plant belongs to the earth. This is the true picture and gives the child an inward joy. Animals must be spoken of always in connection with humans. All animal qualities and physical characteristics are to be found, in some form, in the human being. Humans as synthesis of the whole animal kingdom. Minerals should not be introduced until twelfth year. History should first be presented in living, imaginative pictures, through legends, myths, and stories. Only at eleven or twelve should any teaching be based on cause and effect, which is foreign to the young child&#x2019;s nature. Some thoughts on punishment, with examples. </li><li> <b>LECTURE 4:</b> Development of imaginative qualities in the teacher. The story of the violet and the blue sky. Children&#x2019;s questions. Discipline dependent on the right mood of soul. The teacher&#x2019;s own preparation for this. Seating of children according to temperament. Retelling of stories. Importance of imaginative stories that can be recalled in later school life. Drawing of diagrams, from ninth year. Completion and metamorphosis of simple figures, to give children feeling of form and symmetry. Concentration exercises to awaken an active thinking as basis of wisdom for later life. Simple color exercises. A Waldorf school timetable. The &#x201c;main lesson.&#x201d; </li><li> <b>LECTURE 5:</b> All teaching matter must be intimately connected with life. In counting, each different number should be connected with the child or what the child sees in the environment. Counting and stepping in rhythm. The body counts. The head looks on. Counting with fingers and toes is good (also writing with the feet). The ONE is the whole. Other numbers proceed from it. Building with bricks is against the child&#x2019;s nature, whose impulse is to proceed from whole to parts, as in medieval thinking. Contrast atomic theory. In real life we have first a basket of apples, a purse of coins. In teaching addition, proceed from the whole. In subtraction, start with minuend and remainder; in multiplication, with product and one factor. Theorem of Pythagoras (eleven&#x2013;twelve years). Details given of a clear, visual proof, based on practical thinking. This will arouse fresh wonder every time. </li><li> <b>LECTURE 6:</b> In first seven years etheric body is an inward sculptor. After seven, child has impulse to model and to paint. Teacher must learn anatomy by modeling the organs. Teaching of physiology (nine to twelve years) should be based on modeling. Between seven and fourteen astral body gradually draws into physical body, carrying the breathing by way of nerves, as playing on a lyre. Importance of singing. Child&#x2019;s experience of well being like that of cows chewing the cud. Instrumental music from beginning of school life, wind or strings. Teaching of languages; up to nine through imitation, then beginnings of grammar, as little translation as possible. Vowels are expression of feeling, consonants are imitation of external processes. Each language expresses a different conception. Compare head, Kopf, testa. The parts of speech in relation to the life after death. If language is rightly taught, out of feeling, eurythmy will develop naturally, expressing inner and outer experiences in ordered movements&#x2015;&#x201c;visible speech.&#x201d; Finding relationship to space in gymnastics. </li><li> <b>LECTURE 7:</b> Between seven and fourteen soul qualities are paramount. Beginnings of science teaching from twelfth year only, and connected with real phenomena of life. The problem of fatigue. Wrong conceptions of psychologists. The rhythmic system, predominant in second period, never tires. Rhythm and fantasy. Composition. Sums from real life, not abstractions. Einstein&#x2019;s theory. The kindergarten&#x2015;imitation of life. Teachers&#x2019; meetings, the heart of the school. Every child to be in the right class for its age. Importance of some knowledge of trades, e.g., shoemaking, handwork, and embroidery. Children&#x2019;s reports&#x2015; characterization, but no grading. Contact with the parents. </li><li> <b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</b> The close relationship of Multiplication and Division. How to deal with both together. Transition from the concrete to the abstract in Arithmetic. Not before the ninth year. Healthiness of English weights and measures as related to real life. Decimal system as an intellectual abstraction. <blockquote> <li> <b>Drawing.</b> Lines have no reality in drawing and painting, only boundaries. How to teach children to draw a tree in shading, speaking only of light and color. (Illustration). Line drawing belongs only to geometry. </li><li> <b>Gymnastics and Sport.</b> Sport is of no educational value, but necessary as belonging to English life. Gymnastics should be taught by demonstration. </li><li> <b>Religious Instruction.</b> Religion lessons in the Waldorf school given by Catholic priest and Protestant pastor. &#x201c;Free&#x201d; religion lessons provided for the other children. Plan of such teaching described, of which the fundamental aim is an understanding of Christianity. The Sunday services. </li><li> <b>Modern Language Lessons.</b> Choice of languages must be guided by the demands of English life. These can be introduced at an early age. Direct method in language teaching. </li></blockquote> </li><li> <b>Closing words</b> by Dr. Steiner on the seriousness of this first attempt to found a school in England.</li></ul></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Master of the Battlefield: Monty&#39;s War Years 1942-1944</h2><p>Traces the career of the British Field Marshal from his decisive victory at El Alamein to the Battle of Normandy and describes his relationships with other Allied military leaders</p><p></p><h2>The New Oxford Annotated Apocrypha, Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version</h2><p>Countless students, professors and general readers alike have relied upon <em>The New Oxford Annotated Apocrypha</em> for essential scholarship and guidance to the Deuterocanonical books of the Bible.

Now at a more succinct 19 chapters, this tried-and-true, widely popular text is known as the &#34;bible of microeconomics,&#34; offering the most clear and accurate presentation of advanced microeconomic concepts. For the new edition, proven author and economic authority Walter Nicholson is joined by new co-author Chris Snyder, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. These highly respected economists draw from their wealth of experience in the classroom and the marketplace, giving the book a practical, real-world perspective. Taking a calculus-based approach, MICROECONOMIC THEORY provides an ideal level of mathematical rigor for upper level undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. Extremely reader-friendly, the book is designed to help students truly understand and apply economic models as it enables them to work directly with theoretical tools, real-world applications, and the latest developments in the study of microeconomics. Insightful graphic presentations help visual learners see the connections between the calculus and the algebra/geometry of the same material. In addition, end-of-chapter problems are now presented in two tiers: Simple numerical/mathematical exercises, which build student intuition, are followed by more analytical, theoretical, and complex problems. Unlike other, more theoretical texts, MICROECONOMIC THEORY presents theory in an accessible way as well as illustrates how it applies in the real world.</p><p>Walter Nicholson is the Ward H.

He was not an architect himself, nor a designer. He simply took pictures, but what pictures! He was, for want of a better description, one of the most sensitive of architectural photographers. More than that, his life--and ironically, tragically and poetically, his death--were fused to Chicago architecture. How he died tells us how he lived: for the beauty in the works of Sullivan, Wright and the others. His story is one that must be told.&#34; --Studs Terkel, author &#34;He was completely understanding of architecture and genius and of the quality of the work he was dealing with. He was single-minded in his pursuit and dedication to quality in history, art and architecture. That is an increasingly rare quality.&#34; --Ada Louise Huxtable, former New York Times architecture critic &#34;Richard was an excellent photographer--sensitive and intelligent, and a very good craftsman&#34;. --John Szarkowski, former Director, Photography, Museum of Modern Art, New York &#34;Richard Nickel was one of those who saw architecture, and who passionately and skillfully pursued its portrayal. He was one of a very small number, and to make his work known would be a fundamental service to architects, students, and teachers as well as to the art of architecture.&#34; --Edgar Kaufmann, Jr., architectural historian</p><p>If Chicago is an architecture lover&#39;s paradise today, it is largely due to the efforts of a single individual. Richard Nickel (1928-1972) was not &#34;just a photographer who happens to take pictures of buildings,&#34; as he modestly called himself. He was a soft-spoken missionary whose passionate one-man campaign to preserve Chicago&#39;s ornate 19th century architectural masterpieces--earmarked for destruction by Mayor Richard J. Daley in the name of progress--inspired a nationwide movement. Richard Cahan&#39;s superb biography of Nickel depicts the photographer&#39;s heroic and ultimately tragic struggle to salvage everything he could get his hands on, first with his trusty view camera and then with a hacksaw and chisel.This riveting biography chronicles the life of a crusader and the early days of the historic preservation movement. Beginning with a portrait of Nickel&#39;s youth on Chicago&#39;s West Side in the 1930&#39;s to his army service as a paratrooper and photographer, it progresses with his studies at the Institute of Design in the 1950&#39;s and his attempts thereafter to save Chicago&#39;s buildings, especially those of Louis Sullivan. Includes 70+ illustrations and a special portfolio of duotone photos, printed on fine paper, taken by Nickel during his lifetime.</p><h2>The Magnificent Ambersons (Modern Library 100 Best Novels)</h2><p><b>Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time</b><br><br>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize when it was first published in 1918, <b>The Magnificent Ambersons</b> chronicles the changing fortunes of three generations of an American dynasty.

A dynasty spanning three generations, the Ambersons' pre-eminence as society's elite is threatened -- not only by a hungry new breed of industrial entrepreneur -- but from its own arrogance and greed. At the center of the story is George Amberson Minafer, the pampered but pitiful, scion of the clan upon whose shoulders the fate of the family fortune will be won...or lost.</p><p>At once an exciting chronicle of a family's rise to fortune and its tortured downfall, it is also a fascinating portrait of the forces that shaped American society.</p></p><h2>Los Angeles Times Sunday Crossword Omnibus, Volume 2 (The Los Angeles Times)</h2><p>This extra-value collection of 200 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Sunday crosswords is a great bargain for anyone who loves fun-filled, pun-filled puzzles.

Their work can be linked to the Neue Sachlichkeit movement of the 1920s and to such masters of German photography as Karl Blossfeldt, August Sander, and Albert Renger-Patzsch. Their photographs of industrial structures, taken over the course of forty years, are the most important body of work in independent objective photography. A keynote of their contributions to "industrial archaeology" has been their creation of typologies of different types of buildings; this book, which accompanies a major retrospective exhibition, collects all known Becher studies of industrial building types and presents them as a visual encyclopedia.Each chapter is devoted to a different structure&#x2015;water towers, coal bunkers, winding towers, breakers (ore, coal, and stone), lime kilns, grain elevators, blast furnaces, steel mills, and factory facades. These are organized according to typologies, most of which are presented as tableaux or suites of about twelve images each. The book contains close to 2000 individual images. The accompanying text by Armin Zweite is an essential art historical consideration of the Bechers' work. This ultimate Becher book stands as a capstone to the Bechers' unique body of work.</p></p><p>Bernd Becher (1931&#x2013;2007) and Hilla Becher (1934&#x2013;2015) worked together as photographers beginning in 1959.

Taking as its topic the promise and shortcomings of the democratic form of government, Tocqueville's great work is at or near the root of such political truths as the litigiousness of American society, the danger of the "tyranny of the majority," the American belief in a small government that intrudes only minimally into the daily lives of the citizenry, and Americans' love of political debate. <i>Democracy in America</i> is the work of a 29-year-old nobleman who, with his friend Gustave de Beaumont, traveled the breadth of Jacksonian America to inquire into the future of French society as revolutionary upheaval gave way to a representative government similar to America's. In his magisterial <i>Tocqueville in America</i>, George Wilson Pierson reconstructs from diaries, letters, and newspaper accounts the two Frenchmen's nine-month tour and their evolving analysis of American society. We see Tocqueville near Detroit, noting the scattered settlement patterns of the frontier and the affinity of Americans for solitude; in Boston, witnessing the jury system at work; in Philadelphia, observing the suffocating moral regimen at the new Eastern State Prison (which still stands); and in New Orleans, disturbed by the racial caste system and the lassitude of the French-speaking population.</p></p><p><p>In his magisterial <i>Tocqueville in America</i>, George Wilson Pierson reconstructs from diaries, letters, and newspaper accounts the Frenchman's nine-month tour and his evolving analysis of American society.</p>Alexis de Tocqueville&#39;s Democracy in America (1835) has long been a touchstone for almost any discussion of the American polity.

Here is humanity in all its innocence and corruption, its wisdom and folly.<br><br></p><p>Count Leo Tolstoy was born on September 9, 1828, in Yasnaya Polyana, Russia. Orphaned at nine, he was brought up by an elderly aunt and educated by French tutors until he matriculated at Kazan University in 1844. In 1847, he gave up his studies and, after several aimless years, volunteered for military duty in the army, serving as a junior officer in the Crimean War before retiring in 1857. In 1862, Tolstoy married Sophie Behrs, a marriage that was to become, for him, bitterly unhappy. His diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism; it served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novels <b>War and Peace</b> (1869) and <b>Anna Karenina</b> (1877), but also in his shorter works. Seeking religious justification for his life, Tolstoy evolved a new Christianity based upon his own interpretation of the Gospels. Yasnaya Polyana became a mecca for his many converts At the age of eighty-two, while away from home, the writer suffered a break down in his health in Astapovo, Riazan, and he died there on November 20, 1910.</p><h2>Finding the Movement: Sexuality, Contested Space, and Feminist Activism (Radical Perspectives)</h2><p>In <i>Finding the Movement</i>, Anne Enke reveals that diverse women&#x2019;s engagement with public spaces gave rise to and profoundly shaped second-wave feminism. Focusing on women&#x2019;s activism in Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis-St. Paul during the 1960s and 1970s, Enke describes how women across race and class created a massive groundswell of feminist activism by directly intervening in the urban landscape. They secured illicit meeting spaces and gained access to public athletic fields. They fought to open bars to women and abolish gendered dress codes and prohibitions against lesbian congregation. They created alternative spaces, such as coffeehouses, where women could socialize and organize. They opened women-oriented bookstores, restaurants, cafes, and clubs, and they took it upon themselves to establish women&#x2019;s shelters, health clinics, and credit unions in order to support women&#x2019;s bodily autonomy.<p></p><p>By considering the development of feminism through an analysis of public space, Enke expands and revises the historiography of second-wave feminism. She suggests that the movement was so widespread because it was built by people who did not identify themselves as feminists as well as by those who did. Her focus on claims to public space helps to explain why sexuality, lesbianism, and gender expression were so central to feminist activism. Her spatial analysis also sheds light on hierarchies within the movement. As women turned commercial, civic, and institutional spaces into sites of activism, they produced, as well as resisted, exclusionary dynamics.</p></p><p>&#34;In places like softball fields, church basements, and dance floors, Anne Enke locates a cast of compelling characters who don&#39;t usually make it into history books. The result is a startlingly original history of second-wave feminism. Enke forces us to think freshly about the 1960s, political mobilization, and the ways that people change the world around them.&#34;--John D&#39;Emilio, coauthor of &#34;Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America&#34;<p>Anne Enke is Associate Professor of Women&#x2019;s Studies, History, and LGBT Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p></p><h2>Death and Burial in Ancient Egypt</h2><p><b>A <i>Book Riot</i> 100 Must-Read Book on Ancient History</b><br><br>Death, burial, and the afterlife were as important to the ancient Egyptians as how they lived. This well-illustrated book explores all aspects of death in ancient Egypt, including beliefs of the afterlife, mummification, the protection of the body, tombs and their construction and decoration, funerary goods, and the funeral itself. It also addresses the relationship between the living and the dead, and the magico-religious interaction of these two in ancient Egyptian culture.<br>Salima Ikram's own experience with experimental mummification and funerary archaeology lends the book many completely original and provocative insights. In addition, a full survey of current development in the field makes this a unique book that combines all aspects of death and burial in ancient Egypt into one volume.</p><p><p>For ancient Egyptians, death was part of the journey of life.</p> <p>The tombs, mortuary temples and mummies the Egyptians produced were a celebration of life and a means of continuing it for eternity.</p> <p> <i>Death and Burial in Ancient Egypt </i>transports us to a different world, to reveal the religion and funerary beliefs of one of the world's greatest civilizations.</p>Salima Ikram is professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, and has worked in Egypt since 1986.

Beginning therapists are understandably anxious about how to proceed and not sure they'll know how to be helpful. (&#x201c;How do you get all of them to come in?&#x201d;) Veterans often speak in abstractions. They have opinions and discuss big social issues &#x2014; social constructionsim, postmodernism, managed care, second-order cybernetics. While it's tempting to use this space to say Important Things, I prefer to be a little more personal. Treating troubled families has given me the deepest satisfaction imaginable, and I hope that the same is, or will be, true for you. </p><p> In this first edition of The Essentials of Family Therapy we've tried to describe the full scope of family therapy &#x2014; its rich history, the classical schools, the latest developments &#x2014; but with more emphasis on clinical practice than history and theory. There are lots of changes in this version: more up-to-date descriptions of the latest models, an expanded treatment of basic clinical practice, a richer description of the contemporary influences on the field, and a more thorough and consistent emphasis on clinical techniques throughout. </p><p> When you read about therapy it can be hard to see past the jargon and political packaging to the essential ideas and practices. So, in preparing this volume, we've traveled widely to visit and observe the actual sessions of the leading practitioners. The result is a more pragmatic, clinical focus. We hope you like it. </p><p> So many people have contributed to my development as a family therapist and to the writing of this book that it's impossible to thank them all. But I would like to single out a few. To the people who taught me family therapy &#x2014; Lyman Wynne, Murray Bowen, and Salvador Minuchin &#x2014; thank you. </p><p> Some of the people who went out of their way to help us prepare this book were Jay Efran, Stephanie Fellenberg, Frank Dattilio, Robert Taibbi, JoEllen Patterson, Joseph Miccuci, Paul Nichols, Insoo Berg, Cheryl Rampage, Kathy Weingarten, Vicki Dickerson, Jeff Zimmerman, Cloe Madanes, Jay Haley, and Salvador Minuchin. To paraphrase John, Paul, George, and Ringo, we get by with a lot of help from our friends &#x2014; and we thank them all and one. </p><p> We are especially grateful to Janice Wiggins, Judy Fifer, and Susan McIntyre at Allyn and Bacon for making a hard job easier. </p><p> Finally, I would like to thank my postgraduate instructors in family life: my wife, Melody, and my children, Sandy and Paul. In the brief span of thirty-three Melody has seen me grow from a shy young man, totally ignorant of how to be a husband and father, to a shy middle-aged man, still bewildered and still trying. Sandy and Paul never cease to amaze me. My little red-haired girl (who can bench press like a football player) is about to return to the States after two and a half years of service in the Peace Corps. Proud of her? You bet I am! And my son Paul, to whom (masculine reticence being what it is) maybe I haven't always shown the depth of my love, has grown to young manhood true to himself, true to his friends, and true to his mother and me. If in my wildest dreams I had imagined children to love and be proud of, I wouldn't even have come close to any as fine as Sandy and Paul. </p><p> Michael P. Nichols<br> Williamsburg, Virginia</p>In this book, the authors describe the full scope of family therapy with a strong emphasis on clinical practice (rather than just history and theory). This book contains up-to-date descriptions of the latest models, an expanded treatment of basic clinical practice, a rich description of the contemporary influences on the field, and a thorough, consistent emphasis on clinical techniques throughout.

Fleming shows how the impulses of the European Enlightenment&#x2015;generally associated with great strides in the liberation of human thought from superstition and traditional religion&#x2015;were challenged by tenacious religious ideas or channeled into the &#x201c;darker&#x201d; pursuits of the esoteric and the occult. His engaging topics include the stubborn survival of the miraculous, the Enlightenment roles of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, and the widespread pursuit of magic and alchemy. <p>Though we tend not to associate what was once called alchemy with what we now call chemistry, Fleming shows that the difference is merely one of linguistic modernization. Alchemy was once the chemistry, of Arabic derivation, and its practitioners were among the principal scientists and physicians of their ages. No point is more important for understanding the strange and fascinating figures in this book than the prestige of alchemy among the learned men of the age.</p><p>Fleming follows some of these complexities and contradictions of the &#x201c;Age of Lights&#x201d; into the biographies of two of its extraordinary offspring. The first is the controversial wizard known as Count Cagliostro, the &#x201c;Egyptian&#x201d; freemason, unconventional healer, and alchemist known most infamously for his ambiguous association with the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, which history has viewed as among the possible harbingers of the French Revolution and a major contributing factor in the growing unpopularity of Marie Antoinette. Fleming also reviews the career of Julie de Kr�dener, the sentimental novelist, Pietist preacher, and political mystic who would later become notorious as a prophet.</p><p>Impressively researched and wonderfully erudite, this rich narrative history sheds light on some lesser-known mental extravagances and beliefs of the Enlightenment era and brings to life some of the most extraordinary characters ever encountered either in history or fiction.</p> 20 illustrations</p><p>John V. Fleming taught humanistic studies at Princeton University for forty years. He is the author of The Anti-Communist Manifestos: Four Books That Shaped the Cold War. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.Fleming's book is about two cultural commonplaces, the so-called darkness of the Middle Ages and the reputed brightness of the later age that called them dark. In nine greatly informative and entertaining chapters, Fleming turns the tables by showing that the enlightenment had a dark side that was an integral part of it. Hence, its dark side must be understood as co-Enlightenment, not as what is often called the Counter-Enlightenment. This, in a deep sense, is an important book in the cultural study of history. --Hans Aarsleff, author of From Locke to Saussure<br><br>John Fleming has written a fascinating, compulsively readable account of the shadowy world that lay just beyond the clear, clean, well-ordered boundaries of the Age of Reason. His protagonists, vividly brought to life, are a motley collection of miracle workers, charlatans, confidence men, and half-crazed visionaries, caught up in a frenzied pursuit of occult truths, secret powers, and illicit pleasures. Never has the Enlightenment seemed stranger. --Stephen Greenblatt, author of The Swerve"<br><br>Fleming s book is about two cultural commonplaces, the so-called darkness of the Middle Ages and the reputed brightness of the later age that called them dark.

"During the course of our conversation, he told me he was planning an imminent trip to Venice. I decided to follow him," she writes at the beginning of <i>Suite V�nitienne</i>, her first artist's book and the crucible of her inimitable fusion of investigatory methods, fictional constructs, the plundering of real life and the composition of self. Over the course of almost two weeks in Venice, Calle notates, in time-stamped entries, her surveillance of Henri B., as well as her own emotions as she seeks, finds and follows him through the labyrinthine streets of Venice. Her investigation is both methodical (calling every hotel, visiting the police station) and arbitrary (sometimes following a stranger&#x2015;a flower delivery boy, for instance&#x2015;hoping someone might lead her to him). This Siglio reissue is a completely new iteration of <i>Suite V�nitienne</i> (first published in 1988 and long out of print), designed in collaboration with Calle to be the definitive English-language edition. Printed on Japanese paper with a die-cut cover and gilded edges, this beautiful new Siglio edition allows readers to devour this crucial and compelling work.<br><b>Sophie Calle</b> (born 1953) is an internationally renowned artist whose controversial works explore the tensions between the observed, the reported, the secret and the unsaid. She has mounted solo shows at major museums around the world and represented France at the Venice Biennale in 2007. Her most recent US exhibition was the acclaimed <i>Rachel, Monique</i> at the Episcopal Church of the Heavenly Rest in Manhattan in 2014.</p><p>Her photographs show the back of a raincoated man as he travels through the winding Venetian streets, a surreal and striking backdrop to her internalised mission. The very beauty of her surroundings has a filmic quality, intensifying the thriller-esque narrative of her project. (Harriet Baker <i>Another Magazine</i>)<br><br>The result is this thrilling book, first published in 1983 and long out of print, now newly reissued in an understated English edition, blending matter-of-fact daily text entries with Calle&#x2019;s elusive black and white photography.<p>For Calle, the idea is to push the bounds of propriety, to go where one wouldn&#x2019;t ordinarily go. This is &#x2015; have no doubt &#x2015; an assault on privacy, autonomy, undertaken without permission and enacted for the public, a public with which the subject may or may not wish to engage.</p><p>That&#x2019;s one of the challenges of her work, the discomfort we feel as she crosses the line. (David L Ulin <i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br>In 1978, when Calle was 25 years old, she returned to Paris after seven years of roaming across North and South America. She struggled to re-adapt to fashionable Parisian society, and after months of reclusiveness, decided to follow people in the streets&#x2015;not because they particularly interested her, but for the pleasure of following them. "I just had to choose a person and follow him and that way my day would simply drift by," she said to Another Magazine. This makes Calle sound like a flaneur, but when she followed a man from Paris to Venice, armed with a blonde wig and a camera, she produced Suite Venitienne (1980), which was quickly noticed and celebrated by both French and international critics.

Tour.</p><p>Kem Nunn's earlier surfing novel <i>Tapping the Source</i> was nominated for an American Book Award. In <i>The Dogs of Winter</i>, he draws again on the eternal legends and tall tales of surfers. Jack Fletcher is a pill-popping photographer on the skids who lucks into the assignment of photographing the aging surfing legend Drew Harmon and two young pros at the Heart Attacks in Northern California--an appropriately difficult-to-reach and shark-infested "mysto spot" reputed to have 30-foot waves. Not all dangers lurk in the ocean, however. The local Indians are unfriendly to outsiders and to each other; Harmon's young wife is obsessed with Indian witchcraft and a murdered local girl; and Harmon cloaks his own demons in laconic surfer-deity mystique. The hapless Fletcher and a local tribal council worker named Travis McCade desperately try to avert the curl of disaster that builds and breaks in this heavily atmospheric novel.Kem Nunn is a third-generation Californian whose previous novels include&nbsp;<i>The Dogs of Winter</i>,&nbsp;<i>Pomona Queen</i>,&nbsp;<i>Unassigned Territory</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Tapping the Source</i>, which was made in to&nbsp;the film <i>Point Break</i>.&nbsp;<i>Tijuana Straits&nbsp;</i>won the Los Angeles Times Book Award.

It engages fundamental issues raised by attempts to define such concepts as mainstream, minority, and "other," and opens up new ways of thinking about culture and representation. All of the texts deal with questions of representation in the broadest sense, encompassing not just the visual but also the social and psychological aspects of cultural identity. Included are important theoretical writings by Homi Bhabha, Helene Cixous, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and Monique Wittig. Their work is juxtaposed with essays on more overtly personal themes, often autobiographical, by Gloria Anzaldua, Bell Hooks, and Richard Rodriguez, among others. This rich anthology brings together voices from many different marginalized groups - groups that are often isolated from each other as well as from the dominant culture. It joins issues of gender, race, sexual preference, and class in one forum but without imposing a false unity on the diverse cultures represented. Each piece in the book subtly changes the way every other piece is read. While several essays focus on specific issues in art, such as John Yau's piece on Wilfredo Lam in the Museum of Modern Art, or James Clifford's on collecting art, others draw from debates in literature, film, and critical theory to provide a much broader context than is usually found in work aimed at an art audience. Topics range from the functions of language to the role of public art in the city, from gay pornography to the meanings of black hair styles. <i>Out There</i> also includes essays by Rosalyn Deutsche, Richard Dyer, Kobena Mercer, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak, Gerald Vizenor and Simon Watney, as well as by the editors.</p><p>Copublished with the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York Distributed by The MIT Press.</p></p><p>Russell Ferguson is Deputy Director for Exhibitions and Programs and Chief Curator at the University of California, Los Angeles, Hammer Museum.<p><i>Out There </i> collects classic essays - Monique Wittig's 'The Straight Mind,' Gayatri Spivak's 'Explanation and Culture: Matginalia' - as well as lesser-known pieces like Richard Rodriguez's 'Complexion,' all kicked off by Cornel West's brilliant polemic 'The New Cultural Politics of Difference.'

Portraits, bed stuff, objects, letters (all that in pictures) plus interviews and facsimile writing by youngsters who do not write much. It&#39;s not Weegee and not Larry Clark</p><p>This unflinching, often shocking photographic portrait of teenage runaways in Los Angeles and San Francisco forgoes both the critical distance of the cautionary tale and the banality of the morality play. Instead, Goldberg forges a more personal, and therefore more horrifying, path. His photographs portray in numbing detail the lives of a loosely knit group of young people, as they shoot heroin, turn tricks, and show off their tattoos. Though photographs dominate the book, a significant portion is devoted to text: interviews, confessionals, and even reproductions of the subjects' writings and drawings. Goldberg is friends with his subjects, and in interviews they refer to him by name. He gets involved with their parents and social workers with varying degrees of success. Goldberg's work, completed between 1987 and 1993, will be exhibited in conjunction with the book's release and will tour the United States until late 1997. One complaint: many of the photographs bleed into the gutter, making them harder to view; a little border would have made a difference. Still, this group portrait is highly recommended for art photography collections.?Adam Mazmanian, "Library Journal"<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.A large-format book about runaway and thrown-away kids, Jim Goldberg's Raised by Wolves sets new standards for documentary photography. Developing approaches employed in his landmark 1985 book Rich and Poor, Goldberg spent months on Los Angeles and San Francisco streets photographing and interviewing his adolescent subjects. Interviews with social workers, police and, most of all, with the adolescent subjects themselves lend dimension to this harrowing picture of American street life and the adversarial institutional culture surrounding it. At the book's heart lie two brilliant but doomed adolescents, Tweeky Dave and Echo; their sad romance lends enormous emotional impact to the book.

To judge by this well-edited assemblage, spanning half a century, Jackson (``Brink'' to friends and students) never saw a landscape he didn't like. He writes with the high excitement of discovery and boosterism. An intellectual who, trained in the classical arts of Europe, came late to appreciate the vernacular style of, say, a Vermont farmhouse or a New Mexico adobe, Jackson championed the cause of the native in all its manifestations. Thus we have his notes on ``helix sports,'' a lovely term for surfing, snowboarding, sailing, and the other ``sports of mobility''; his careful study of the transformation of the American backyard and garage from places of work to places of private recreation (and, now that garages are being remade into home offices, to places of work once again); his thoughtful remarks on the best uses of shared spaces, of ``learning to use them in a temporary way in order to overcome both the old-fashioned biological exclusiveness and the more modern emphasis on competition and control.'' Jackson exhibits any number of well-considered prejudices, among them a liking for not-too-orderly urban centers; at one point, he proposes that the Ford Foundation give grants to students of city planning with the condition that ``for a year they would look at no picture books of Brave New Sweden and spend the time instead in the heart of some chaotic, unredeemed, ancient city.'' Editor Horowitz, a historian at Smith College, recounts Jackson's career as a freelance scholar, reminding us that, as a self-taught geographer, he was always held in some mistrust by the academy. Highly recommended for geographers and students of the American scene. (51 illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And despite Peter's charge to be "ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you" (1 Peter 3:15), most Christian laypeople have left apologetics&#x2014;the defense of the faith&#x2014;to the ecclesiastical "pros." Faith Has Its Reasons is a study of four different models of how apologetics should be done, an assessment of their strengths and weaknesses, and a proposal for integrating the best insights of each.<br> <br> Kenneth Boa and Robert Bowman have assembled a wealth of information about what Christians believe and how to present that faith to an unbelieving world. Remarkable both in its depth of content and ease of accessibility, Faith Has Its Reasons gives Christian laypeople the tools to address such critical questions as: <br> &nbsp;<br> <br> Why is belief in God rational despite the prevalence of evil in the world? <br> What facts support the church's testimony that Jesus rose from the dead? <br> Can we be certain Christianity is true? <br> How can our faith in Christ be based on something more secure than our own understanding without descending into an irrational emotionalism? <br></p><p>Dr. Kenneth D.

Her first book of poetry, <i>April Twilights, </i>was published in 1903, but Cather significantly revised and expanded it in a 1923 edition entitled <i>April Twilights and Other Poems. </i>This Everyman&#x2019;s Library edition reproduces for the first time all the poems from both versions of <i>April Twilights</i>, along with a number of uncollected and previously unpublished poems by Cather, as well as an illuminating selection of her newly released letters.<br><br> In such lyrical poems as &#x201c;The Hawthorn Tree,&#x201d; &#x201c;Winter at Delphi,&#x201d; &#x201c;Prairie Spring,&#x201d; &#x201c;Poor Marty,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Going Home,&#x201d; Cather exhibits both a finely tuned sensitivity to the beauties of the physical world and a richly symbolic use of the landscapes of myth. The themes that were to animate her later masterpieces found their first expression in these haunting, elegiac ballads and sonnets.</p><p><b>WILLA CATHER</b>, author of twelve novels, including <i>O Pioneers!, My �ntonia</i>, and <i>Death Comes for the Archbishop</i>, was born in Virginia in 1873 but grew up in Nebraska, where many of her novels are set. She died in 1947 in New York City.<i>Excerpted from the Foreword</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When she was in her twenties, Willa Sibert Cather (1873&#x2013;1947) was by any estimate a one-woman literary industry: excerpts from her collected articles and reviews from this time, published mostly in newspapers in Lincoln, Nebraska and Pittsburgh, run to over one thousand pages in two volumes (<i>The World and the Parish</i>, 1970). During this period too she produced stories and poems, tried her hand at a book of drama criticism that never appeared, and was the first American editor &#x2013; when she was just twenty-three &#x2013; to republish poems from a new book by A. E. Housman, <i>A Shropshire Lad </i>(1896). When Cather did publish her first book in the spring of 1903, the year she turned thirty, it is not surprising that her <i>April Twilights</i> displays Housman&#x2019;s evident influence, among others. That book, published in Boston by Richard G. Badger &#x2013; a vanity publisher who, notwithstanding, brought out volumes by various poets of note, such as E. A. Robinson &#x2013; garnered some reasonable reviews, won some admiration, but made no real splash.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>April Twilights</i> was the first book by this author whose career as a writer spanned the years from 1890s fin de sie`cle decadence through the Modernism of the 1920s and &#x2019;30s, and as a poet from the conventional prosody of the late Victorians through the free verse of the Imagists. Steeped in the literary, Cather initially took her inspiration from the classical tradition and from the poets of the nineteenth century, British, Continental, and American. In Housman&#x2019;s <i>A Shropshire Lad</i> she found a new, authentic voice speaking with freshness and clarity through poems whose inspiration derived from a source she herself saw and felt &#x2013; a well-known home place recalled in precise detail and tinged with recollected longings. Its best-known poem is &#x2018;&#x2018;To an Athlete Dying Young,&#x2019;&#x2019; and that poem echoes throughout Cather&#x2019;s work. Housman&#x2019;s poems called out to Cather sufficiently to draw her to his Shropshire during her first visit to Europe in 1902. Having seen and delighted in his places, she wrote to Dorothy Canfield from there that &#x2018;&#x2018;somehow it makes it all the greater to have it all true.&#x2019;&#x2019; In that same letter she offers the three stanzas that were to conclude her &#x2018;&#x2018;Poppies on Ludlow Castle.&#x2019;&#x2019; On return from Shropshire, having discovered Housman&#x2019;s address in London, Cather and her traveling companions visited the poet there unannounced. The meeting proved awkward, leaving Cather disappointed. There are a number of versions of what took place, and it was a moment in Cather&#x2019;s biography that earned her some notoriety and also vexed her. Even when she died in 1947 she was seeking to set the record of that visit straight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever happened that day in Highgate, when <i>April Twilights</i> appeared the next year Housman&#x2019;s influence was palpable: just after its publication Cather wrote to Viola Roseboro&#x2019; &#x2013; the fiction reader at <i>McClure&#x2019;s</i> who would successfully facilitate Cather&#x2019;s hiring by that magazine in 1906 &#x2013; that she had &#x2018;&#x2018;been Housman&#x2019;s bond slave, mentally, since his first volume appeared some six years ago.&#x2019;&#x2019; Beyond Housman&#x2019;s influence, Cather the young poet may be seen in <i>April Twilights</i> embracing her classical inheritance through several poems on classical themes (&#x2018;&#x2018;Fides, Spes,&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;In Media Vita,&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;Winter at Delphi&#x2019;&#x2019;), writing poems inspired by the scenes she saw in Britain (&#x2018;&#x2018;London Roses&#x2019;&#x2019;) and, especially, in France (&#x2018;&#x2018;Mills of Montmartre,&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;Paris&#x2019;&#x2019;), and eulogizing an artist who died young, her Pittsburgh friend, the composer Ethelbert Nevin (&#x2018;&#x2018;Arcadian Winter,&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;Sleep, Minstrel, Sleep&#x2019;&#x2019;). Tentatively, as well, Cather may be seen in her first book treating subjects which would prove ultimately to be central to her fiction: her family (&#x2018;&#x2018;Dedicatory,&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;&#x2018;Grandmither, Think Not I Forget,&#x2019;&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;The Namesake&#x2019;&#x2019;) and her home place in the West (&#x2018;&#x2018;White Birch in Wyoming,&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;The Night Express,&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2018;&#x2018;Prairie Dawn&#x2019;&#x2019;). A review of <i>April Twilights</i> in the <i>Kansas City Star</i> described it as &#x2018;&#x2018;a new little volume which holds pages of charming poetry,&#x2019;&#x2019; while the <i>New York Times</i> reviewer wrote that Cather&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;gift is genuine, her performance already beautiful, and giving promise to be looked for with eagerness,&#x2019;&#x2019; going on to note that her &#x2018;&#x2018;slim first volume holds such a variety of metres, and so considerable a number of poems nearly equal in delicate whimsical charm, that the choice of any one for quotation is difficult.&#x2019;&#x2019; Read today and with such responses in mind, April Twilights is a book that fits just who Willa Sibert Cather was in 1903: a person steeped in the literary, possessed of some small initial accomplishment in writing; a person intent on trying her hand at what was possible and what was then done; a person of considerable literary ambition.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a decade after <i>April Twilights</i> appeared Cather continued to publish poems &#x2013; often in <i>McClure&#x2019;s</i> where she was Managing Editor from 1908 to 1911 &#x2013; but with the publication of <i>The Troll Garden</i> (1905) her primary genre became prose fiction. Yet that book&#x2019;s title and epigraphs acknowledged inspiration from Christina Rossetti&#x2019;s &#x2018;&#x2018;The Goblin Market&#x2019;&#x2019; and also from a parable by Charles Kingsley connected to the fall of Rome. So Cather was still inspired, primarily, by the literary and by Old World cultural inheritances. The collection&#x2019;s stories are largely concerned with art and artists, though there too Cather showed herself increasingly drawn to the West as her setting. This shift was paralleled in the poems she wrote during this time and, when she ultimately hit what she subsequently called &#x2018;&#x2018;the home pasture&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2013; that is, her true subject and approach some of her own poetry was front and center. <i>OPioneers</i>! (1913), the book Cather saw as her true first novel, begins with one of her poems, &#x2018;&#x2018;Prairie Spring,&#x2019;&#x2019; as one of its epigraphs. Two years later, when Cather published her most autobiographical novel, <i>The Song of the Lark</i>, she used a poem of hers as part of that book&#x2019;s dedication to Isabelle McClung, a love of Cather&#x2019;s life:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On uplands,<br> At morning, The world was young, the winds were free;<br> A garden fair,<br> In that blue desert air, Its guest invited me to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> With its image of western lands and its look back to a pastoral garden, this poem combines Cather&#x2019;s poetic inheritance with the direction she was then taking, for just as she was looking toward the pioneering West in her prose so she was in her poetry too.<br> &nbsp;<br> As this shift was happening, Cather responded in October 1915 to a question from her editor at Houghton Mifflin, Ferris Greenslet, who had asked if she might want to publish a revised volume of her poems. Cather replied that she would like &#x2018;&#x2018;to bring out an expurgated and revised edition of <i>April Twilights</i> sometime.&#x2019;&#x2019; While Houghton Mifflin never published such a book, after Cather changed her publisher with <i>Youth and the Bright Medusa</i> in 1920, Alfred A. Knopf did. <i>April Twilights and Other Poems</i> appeared from Knopf in spring 1923; its publication coincided with the Pulitzer Prize she won for <i>One of Ours</i> (1922). Thus as her career as a fiction writer was really taking off, Cather remained interested in her poetry and was actively reshaping it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just as <i>Youth and the Bright Medusa</i> had combined some of the stories from <i>The Troll Garden</i> with newer ones, <i>April Twilights and Other Poems</i> follows the same pattern. The revised collection is a very different book from its predecessor; it is in fact an &#x2018;&#x2018;expurgated&#x2019;&#x2019; rendering of Cather as poet in the sense that it represents her poems both stylistically and with greater emphasis on her own westward movement. One might quite reasonably see them as different books altogether. She omitted thirteen poems from the earlier volume and added another twelve &#x2013; as an identified and separate section &#x2013; made up of poems written since 1903, most published in McClure&#x2019;s and other periodicals. With them, Cather did not altogether abandon European scenes as inspiration but, overall, she followed the direction announced with &#x2018;&#x2018;Prairie Spring&#x2019;&#x2019; as an epigraph to <i>O Pioneers!:</i> she had turned her face West, to the stuff of her own experience in her own home place, and, as also in that poem, she rendered her ideas through less conventional prosody. <i>April Twilights and Other Poems</i> ends with two poems that, themselves, end with the word &#x2018;&#x2018;home&#x2019;&#x2019;: &#x2018;&#x2018;Recognition&#x2019;&#x2019; (1923) and &#x2018;&#x2018;Going Home (Burlington Route)&#x2019;&#x2019; (1923). In the latter Cather writes:<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> How smoothly the trains run beyond the Missouri; Even in my sleep I know when I have crossed the river. The wheels turn as if they were glad to go; They run like running water, Like Youth, running away . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Arguably, this same transformation occurred in Cather&#x2019;s prose &#x2013; sharp, clear prose that has long been judged &#x2018;&#x2018;poetic&#x2019;&#x2019; &#x2013; as she moved from the conventional third-person structures of <i>O Pioneers!</i> and <i>The Song of the Lark </i>to the radical Modernist structures of <i>My �ntonia</i> (1918), <i>The Professor&#x2019;s House</i> (1925), <i>My Mortal Enemy</i> (1926) and <i>Death Comes for the Archbishop</i> (1927). This image of home and of &#x2018;&#x2018;Youth, running away . . .&#x2019;&#x2019; connects to the lyric impulse and, as well and again, to looming death.<br> &nbsp;<br> When <i>April Twilights</i> was reviewed in 1903 Cather was seen as a new, though conventional, voice &#x2013; a writer to watch, making a creditable appearance through a known but vanity press. When <i>April Twilights and Other Poems</i> appeared in early 1923 from a major though still relatively new publisher and was being reviewed that spring, Cather was established as a rapidly rising presence who was just about to win, or had just won, a big prize. Her next novel of the West, <i>A Lost Lady</i>, was then being serialized in <i>Century</i> and would appear as a book that fall. Given all this, her beginnings as a poet were, reasonably, little known. Such perspective was evident in the book&#x2019;s notices. Mark Van Doren, in the <i>Nation</i>, wrote in June 1923 after the Pulitzer had been announced that in her novels &#x2018;&#x2018;one comes home to an epic poet, to a great writer who deals simply and profoundly with love, age, separation, death, heroes, gods, and the land. No end of passion is there, and no end of reality. But her &#x2018;Poems,&#x2019; so printed and so called, are not great.&#x2019;&#x2019; Van Doren ends by asserting that &#x2018;&#x2018;a poem like &#x2018;Spanish Johnny&#x2019; reminds us of <i>The Song of the Lark</i>, and the reminder is fatal.&#x2019;&#x2019; William Rose Benet, less categorical but equally unimpressed, wrote in <i>The Literary Review</i> that <i>April Twilights and Other Poem</i>s &#x2018;&#x2018;is but a slight pendant to her outstanding work in prose.&#x2019;&#x2019; Another reviewer, writing in 1933 in the <i>New York Herald-Tribune </i>after Cather had added her major late poem, &#x2018;&#x2018;Poor Marty&#x2019;&#x2019; (1931), to the collection, explicitly defines the relation between Cather&#x2019;s poems and her prose: &#x2018;&#x2018;The setting is the prairies and their strange and sometimes harsh beauty.

For each math concept presented, early childhood educators learn how it can be incorporated into music and movement, language and visual arts, science, and social studies for children from birth through age eight. Problem solving is promoted as the major means for constructing concepts with a balance of naturalistic, informal, and structured activities. The content is compatible with national standards and guidelines, providing the tools needed to prepare children to meet these standards. Each concept unit contains assessment, instructional, and evaluation strategies that can be put to use immediately. Additional resources include active approaches to mathematics, resources for establishing learning centers, guidance on parental involvement, lists of children&#39;s books with math concepts, and related websites.</p><p>Rosalind Charlesworth is professor emerita and retired department chair in the Department of Child and Family Studies at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah. Dr Charlesworth&#39;s career in early childhood education has included experiences with both typical and atypical young children in laboratory schools, public schools and day care and through research in social and cognitive development and behaviour.I like how each chapter covers naturalistic, informal, and structured experiences to reinforce what is learned at the beginning of the text. It is also very important for preschool teachers to understand the difference of those experiences and know which are more developmentally appropriate for young children.</p><h2>Educational Psychology: Developing Learners (8th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>This title is also available packaged with the Enhanced Pearson eText.
